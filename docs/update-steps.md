Does the following procedure make sense for updating a 9-year old Java codebase (about 100 .java files)? 
1. Document (add comments & TODOs)
2. Unit tests
3. Refactor a bit
4. Update libs
5. Modernise Java
Every few changes check it still builds and tests pass, occasionally make sure it still runs. It's all in git, maven for build.
Anything I'm missing?

Using linux regex facilities, how do I change every file in the directory tree so that "@see DataStamp" becomes "@see it.danja.newsmonitor.model.DateStamp"?

find ./ -type f -name "*.java" -exec sed -i 's/@see DataStamp/@see it.danja.newsmonitor.model.DateStamp/g' {} +

find ./ -type f -name "*.html" -exec sed -i 's|<a href="">|<a href="https://hyperdata.it">|g' {} +


find ./ -type f -name "*.java" -exec sed -i 's/@date/dc:date/g' {} +

find . -name "*.java" -type f | wc -l

Act as a Java programmer, following best practices. You will be given a series of Java source file, package by package. When prompted "add comments", add Javadoc-compatible comments to the code, at the file, class and method level. You should retain the original Java code as-is. Do not omit the implementations. They should describe the associated code in a very concise manner, including references elsewhere as appropriate. Improve any existing comments in the same manner. Make sure to include the existing code. The author's name is danja, the date is 2023-08-14 and the version is 1.20.23. Remember the general functionality of the code until given the prompt "make package doc". At this point write the source of a package.html to go with the previous source files. Always include the original implementation code in your responses.

// implementation omitted for brevity

// ... existing code ...

    // ... code ...
    // Rest of the code
    
    // ...
    
    
    please repeat the previous task, this time including the original implementation code
    
    repeat the previous task, including comments and the original implementation code
