    <h2><a name="overview"> Overview</a></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NewsMonitor</span> is a proposed OSGi
      module for <a href="http://www.fusepool.eu/">Fusepool</a>/<a href="https://stanbol.apache.org/">Apache
        Stanbol</a>. It's primary operation will be that of a (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>/<a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator">feed
        reader/aggregator</a>, not unlike the online <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_aggregator">Planet</a>-style
      aggregators which tend to be focused on a specific subject domain (e.g. <a
        href="http://planet.python.org/">Planet Python</a>, <a href="http://planet.atlantides.org/electra/">Electra
        Atlantis: Digital Approaches to Antiquity</a>, <a href="http://www.starastronomy.org/aggregator">Star
        Astronomy</a>). However, it will employ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web">Semantic
        Web</a> technologies to go far beyond the functionality typically found
      in feed readers. By aggregating feed metadata and extracting data from
      (human-readable) feed content, it will provide linked data access to much
      more information. Additionally, there will be feed discovery
      functionality, allowing the system to automatically find and subscribe to
      feeds which are relevant to the given topic.</p>
    <p>In summary, it will :<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>discover feeds containing posts in the given subject domain</li>
      <li>aggregate content</li>
      <li>identify and extract information from feed metadata and content</li>
      <li>expose the results as linked data using established vocabularies</li>
      <li>display results via Web UI </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The components and functionality of NewsMonitor map to aspects of the
      Fusepool <a href="http://datahackaward.org/">Data|Hack|Award|2014</a>
      call as follows :</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use cases</span> (described below)</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Refine data</span> - RDF will be
        extracted from the structured data found in feeds, both through refining
        RSS/Atom metadata and entity extraction applied to the content</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reuse data</span> - the data obtained
        will be aggregated according to topic and displayed as a combined news
        channel, with corresponding linked data exposed</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Release data</span> - as above, with
        a live demo</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Developer</span> :
      the NewsMonitor module will be developed by Danny Ayers as a lone coder
      (aided by the Fusepool group), devoting as much time as necessary to the
      project. </p>

    <h2><a name="motivation">Motivation</a><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-style: italic;">
          - </span></span>why feeds? </h2>
    <p>There is a significant quantity of useful user-generated content on the
      Web, and much of it is found in blogs. This represents a hugely valuable
      resource that is currently underused. By automatically aggregating and
      distilling the information found in this content, it may be exposed in a
      fashion that provides much more value to the end user. A large proportion
      of blogs and news sites provide RSS or Atom feeds, which although rarely
      'clean', is structured data which is much more suitable for conversion to
      Semantic Web models than arbitrary HTML.</p>
    <p>The advantages of this information include :<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>more human-digestible than typical Semantic Web data</li>
      <li>generated in real time, without the latency found in traditional
        journalism and formal research</li>
      <li>not constrained by national borders, usually open and free</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It should be noted there are disadvantages with this source of
      information, some of which will have implications for the implementation
      of NewsMonitor. The disadvantages of feed material include :<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>informal language, more ambiguity</li>
      <li>less rigorous than conventional journalism/research</li>
      <li>potential legal/copyright complications</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="data_sources">Data Sources</a></h2>
    <p>To bootstrap the system, a set of URLs of feeds associated with the
      desired topic will be required. Additionally, RDF vocabularies and keyword
      dictionaries will be required to determine relevance of given sites and to
      identify entities in content.</p>
    <p>The system will be domain-agnostic, but to demonstrate that it may be
      reused for different topics, at least two should be tried out during
      development. There are many vocabularies available on the Web, and there
      are existing dictionaries/vocabularies for string/dictionary matching
      within Fusepool (plus those to be provided by ProcessMonitor [Alexandro]
      and PlanningMapper [Andreas]). </p>
    <p>Candidate topics include : </p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">European Parliament</span> - focusing on
      MEPs. As well as being informative, this would also provide data for
      sentiment analysis, e.g. estimating the popularity of individual MEPs.
      This should be a good starting point during development as the domain is
      relatively constrained so a reasonably small dictionary may be used.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Medical</span> - diseases,
      pharmaceuticals etc. This is a broad domain and will require a much larger
      keyword dictionary. As such it should make a good test of relevance
      determination at the other extreme to MEPs.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Semantic Web</span> - RDF, linked data
      etc. As well as (hopefully) being of interest to Fusepool developers,
      there are two reasons why this may make a good choice of topic, both
      relating to the <a href="http://planetrdf.com/">Planet RDF</a> site.
      Firstly this site offers a feedlist (<a href="http://journal.dajobe.org/journal/2003/07/semblogs/bloggers.rdf">blogger.rdf</a>)
      that has been manually compiled over several years and should make an
      excellent seed list for NewsMonitor. Secondly, as the site is of known
      relevance, it should make a good reference against which to compare the
      results of feed discovery by NewsMonitor.</p>
    <h2><a name="users">Potential Users</a></h2>
    <p>At least four demographics are most likely to be interested in
      NewsMonitor, for viewing and/or deployment :<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>domain professionals</li>
      <li>lay users - you and I</li>
      <li>journalists</li>
      <li>linked data developers<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="use_cases">Use Cases</a></h2>
    <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
      main use case for NewsMonitor is<span lang="en-US"> to allow an end user
        to monitor articles on topics relevant to them. The fact that the system
        may be configured for a specific domain leaves the door open for use
        cases applicable to the chosen domain. For example, as mentioned
        earlier, in the European Parliament domain the data generated may be
        used for determining popularity of particular MEPs. In the medical
        domain, a possible use case could be the </span>indication of potential
      drug side effects. In a way this could be seen as passively crowdsourcing
      research. Given the informality and immediacy of blogs they are excellent
      for augmenting information obtained from more formal sources.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>It should also be noted that thanks to the use of Semantic Web
      technologies, there will be plenty of scope for unanticipated reuse and
      serendipity.</p>
    <h2><a name="legacy">Legacy for Fusepool</a></h2>
    <p>Assuming everything goes according to plan, upon completion it is
      believed that NewsMonitor will add significant value to the Fusepool
      project. Specifically it will provide :</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Showcase Application - good for quick start, and offers an
        application that has immediate value for end users</li>
      <li>Application reusable for different domains</li>
      <li>Poller/Aggregator component (in module)</li>
      <li>Intelligent Discovery Engine component (in module)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="architecture">System Architecture</a></h2>
    <img style="width: 640px; height: 385px;" alt="architecture" title="architecture"
      src="images/architecture-overview.png"><br>
    <br>
    The main components of the system are the <a href="#DataContent_Store">Data/Content
      Store</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">Fusepool ECS</span> (shown in
    the diagram as the three blue cylinders), the <a href="#Poller">Poller</a>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">NewsMonitor component</span>, a set of
    data <a href="#Extractors">Extractors</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">NewsMonitor
      RDFizers and existing Fusepool components</span> and the <a href="#Discovery_Engine">Discovery
      Engine</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">NewsMonitor component</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="DataContent_Store"></a>
    <h3>Data/Content Store</h3>
    Three sets of data will be contained in the store:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Dictionaries/Ontologies will used to guide data extraction and help
        determine page relevance within the Discovery Engine</li>
      <li>Discovery Rules will be applied against entities extracted from
        candidate page content (and page metadata) to determine page relevance</li>
      <li>Page Metadata &amp; Content will be the feedlist and material derived
        from subscribed feeds. This is the primary output of the system</li>
    </ul>
    <a name="Poller"></a>
    <h3>Poller</h3>
    The role of the Poller is to periodically step through the URLs in the
    feedlist and to obtain any new material found in those feeds.<br>
    <br>
    <a name="Extractors"></a>
    <h3>Extractors</h3>
    The role of the extractors is to :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>convert feed content to RDF</li>
      <li>extract entities from entry content</li>
      <li>extract linked URLs as potential sources of further relevant feeds<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <a name="Discovery_Engine"></a>
    <h3>Discovery Engine</h3>
    The role of the Discovery Engine is to take the URLs and entities from a a
    given entry and by means of a series of heuristics determine the relevance
    of the target page. Part of the heuristics will be rule-driven, with the
    rules contained in the data store.<br>
    Simple heuristics will also be applied to find feeds linked from the target
    page (Feed Autodiscovery and scraping).<br>
    by a set of relevance measures<br>
    <h2> <a name="flow">Program Flow</a></h2>
    The system will be initialized by loading the feedlist into working memory
    (the seed feedlist will previously have been loaded from file).<br>
    <br>
    There will then be three main threads running concurrently. The Poller
    thread will loop through feed URLs getting new content/data and passing it
    into the store. The Extractor thread will examine new content and identify
    entities and any other potentially useful data found in the feeds, including
    any URLs pointing to other sites. This data will also be passed into the
    store. The Discovery thread will take the remote URLs found by the
    Extractor, and for each URL determine a relevance score for the target page.
    If the score is above the given threshold, feed autodiscovery will be
    applied to the target page to find any associated RSS/Atom feeds, the URLs
    of which will be added to the feedlist. Relevance checks will also
    periodically be made on feeds already on the list, and should they fall
    below a given threshold their URLs will be removed from the active list
    (along with any feeds that are unavailable).<br>
    <br>
    The exact details of all these are to be decided, it's anticipated that
    considerable experimentation will be needed, especially around determining
    the relevance score.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Poller Thread</span><br>
    <br>
    for each URL :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Conditional GET to retrieve feed content</li>
      <li>feed content translated to RDF</li>
      <li>(on first run only) feed top-level metadata passed to store</li>
      <li>new content and post-level metadata passed to store</li>
      <li>entity extraction applied to </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extractor Thread</span></p>
    <p>This will apply existing Fusepool/Stanbol components to identify entities
      in entries, along with whatever custom extraction is deemed necessary
      (e.g. URLs and link labels for remote sites. </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discovery Engine Thread</span><br>
    <br>
    This will apply heuristics to the data retrieved from feeds alongside
    dictionaries/vocabularies to determine likely relevance of candidate sites.
    Initially this will be based on simple keyword matching, with other
    approaches being added as time permits (ideally the relevance tools will be
    pluggable, so the configuration can easily be changed and other tools added
    according to what isfound to work well with the given subject domain).<br>
    <h2><a name="interfaces">External Interfaces</a></h2>
    <h3> Summary</h3>
    The interfaces will primarily be accessing the graph(s) associated with the
    Content, Page Metadata and Entities extracted from the feeds, using the HTTP
    protocol. For machine-machine communications, this should be mostly
    achievable using existing Fusepool functionality, although access to
    NewsMonitor components is desirable. The user interfaces will be in-browser
    using standard HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript technologies. <br>
    <br>
    The interfaces will expose the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>system data</li>
      <li>feed data</li>
      <li>aggregated posts, keyword searchable</li>
      <li> linked data (using established vocabularies)</li>
      <li> SPARQL Endpoint</li>
      <li> RESTful interfaces to system components as appropriate</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Administration Page</h3>
    <p>The admin page with include UI elements to control the following :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>shutdown</li>
      <li>start/stop polling</li>
      <li>polling period (time between refreshes)</li>
      <li>start/stop extraction</li>
      <li>extraction period</li>
      <li>start/stop discovery</li>
      <li>discovery period</li>
      <li>add feed URL</li>
      <li>relevancy threshold to subscribe to new sources</li>
      <li>relevancy threshold to remove feeds from the active list</li>
      <li>expiry time for entries (from one day to infinite)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The admin page will also include a list of subscribed feeds. Each of
      these will have a control to allow removal of feed from the active list.</p>
    <p>It is likely that other controls will be desirable, such as choice of
      extraction and relevancy tools. This will be added as time permits.</p>
    <p>Again, as time permits, per-feed statistics will also be provided.</p>
    <h3>Activity Log</h3>
    <p>Each of the components of the system will log its activity to a common
      location (ideally the store). These logs will be viewable as a Web page,
      ideally with control over the level of detail.</p>
    <h3>Feed View Pages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">1-Pane</span> : “River of News” -
        recent posts sorted by individual post date and/or most recently updated
        blog (<a href="RiverofNews-mockup.html">mockup</a>)</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-Pane</span> :&nbsp; feedlist, entry
        titles, individual entry content (<a href="3-Pane-mockup.html">mockup</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> RDF View Pages</h3>
    To explore the data generated by the system, some form of navigable
    interface will be provided over it. In the first instance the existing
    Fusepool RDF UI will be used, which (as time permits and necessity demands)
    may later be customized. Additional custom UIs may be added later.<br>

    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="roadmap">Roadmap &amp; Milestones</a></h2>
    The plan is to approach development in a very iterative fashion, aiming to
    get a quick &amp; dirty system featuring core functionality together as soon
    as possible. This will then be refactored as functionality is extended.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>identify existing Fusepool/Stanbol components that fulfill parts of
        the requirements</li>
      <li> hack prototype system, virtually standalone - will use external
        triplestore (<a href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/">Fuseki</a>)
        for storage, accessing via SPARQL 1.1</li>
      <li> minimum viable product... (i.e. get it working!)</li>
      <li> replace/refactor prototypes components into OSGi and integrate with
        Fusepool</li>
      <li> custom UIs (if necessary)</li>
      <li> live demo deployment</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> </h2>
    Development will take place over two months. The first month will be devoted
    to getting a basic prototype up and running. The second month will be
    devoted to integrating this with Fusepool/Stanbol, making the system robust
    and adding extra functionality as time permits. Different areas may be
    addressed in parallel, though to ensure progress is being made, the
    provisional roadmap&nbsp; looks like this :<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">end of week</span><br>
    <ol>
      <li> identify usable Fusepool/Stanbol components, clarify requirements
        &amp; design</li>
      <li> prototype poller</li>
      <li> prototype extractor &amp; discovery components</li>
      <li> prototype system integration</li>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">details to be decided</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-style: italic;">details to be decided</span></li>
      <li> completed components, OSGi module integrated with Fusepool</li>
      <li> live demo </li>
    </ol>
    <h2> <a name="questions">Open Questions</a></h2>
    As development has only just started, many aspects have yet to be pinned
    down. It is hoped that the following points will be clarified by the time
    the prototype is ready (end of week 4) :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>time, cost, scope..?</li>
      <li> existing components?</li>
      <li> custom UI?</li>
      <li> discovery rules engine : use RDFS/OWL reasoning? SPARQL? Drools?</li>
      <li> copyright issues?</li>
      <li> subproject name(s)..?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> <a name="future">Future Enhancements</a></h2>
    It is expected that the project as described above is quite ambitious for
    the time available, though it will be open to lots of extension. It is hoped
    that development will be continued, especially with community input. Here
    are some possible enhancements :<br>
    <ul>
      <li> real-time actions triggered in response to search queries</li>
      <li> user interaction, voting up/down sources</li>
      <li> per-user customization</li>
      <li> UI integration with more of LOD cloud</li>
      <li> enrichment with schema.org, RDFa annotation of human-oriented views</li>
      <li>exploit any FOAF or other personal profile data about bloggers to
        build a social dimension into the system</li>
    </ul>
