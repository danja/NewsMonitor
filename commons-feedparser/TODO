Project Management:

    - Get viewcvs linked to the app

- [DONE] Nightly builds? (requested with Craig)

    - 0.5 public release

        http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/releases/index.html




    - maven?

- (DONE) All FeedParser exceptions should include the URL of the feed if
  possible.  This will really help with debugging
    
- (DONE) Implementation of RSS/Atom autodiscovery...

- (DONE) Remove ALL references to newsmonster IO layer.

- (DONE) Support MetaFeedParser.onCreated() for RSS 2.0 /rss/channel/item/pubdate

- (DONE) Implement RSS 2.0 enclosure linkage ... this should be an onLink handler.

- (DONE) Atom GUIDs and RSS 2.0 GUIDs

- (DONE) Rework the factory mechanism to support multiple FeedParsers... should
  be an interface.

- How do I want to maintain a public    changelog?

- How do I want to maintain a public TODO?

- UTF-16 tests for unicode and checksum the content.

- Fix the feedparsing bug where we'll drop chars:

    current-broken-drop-accents.atom

    The bug is in getCorrectInputStream

- Networking layer should support per-request UserAgent settings.  This should
  just be a request header I think


- Won't build with the maven version with Jaxen 1.0.  What version of Jaxen are
  we running?  This is a big problem if we can't figure this out.

    - The older betas are NOT present so I really don't have any way to figure
      this out... Do I?  When did I add it to NewsMonster?

- What build of JDOM are we running?
    1.0beta9 built January 24 2003

- Would it be possible to dump JDOM and use DOM with Jaxen until we're ready to
  use SAX?

- Maven javadoc is broken.  Why is this?

- Better Atom support:

    - Support Base64 Atom values and the ability to enable them to be
      automatically decoded.
        
    - Atom's xml:base is NOT supported right now.  We NEED to support this.

    - Do we support multiple content items in Atom?


- Where do we store global options like USER_AGENT, STRICT_PARSING, and
  STRICT_SPECw




- Unit tests don't need to be so LOUD!!

- tests for:

    - RSS and Atom GUIDs
    - Atom content
    - Atom summary
    - xml:base expansion

    - http://www.intertwingly.net/stories/2004/04/04/title.html


- http://feedparser.org/docs/html-sanitization.html#advanced.sanitization.why

    Hm...


- FIXME: documentation on using HTTP authentication

- BUG:

    Make SURE that all these tests work

     http://diveintomark.org/tests/client/autodiscovery/

- We do not support multipart/alternative in the feedparser.
 
- Migrate away from JDOM (slower than just using DOM/SAX)

- Test cases shouldn't use absolute paths.

- Support textinput which we don't support now


- Break down requirements into specific versions of libraries that we need.
