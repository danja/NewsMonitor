TV stations contributing segments include: Abu Dhabi TV, UAE; Al Manar TV, Lebanon; Jordan TV, Jordan; IBA TV, Israel; Prime Minster Ariel Sharon is expected to give a speech about evacuating settlements if negotiations with Palestinians fail. There is a possibility that illegal settlement posts, that were built in the last few months, will be evacuated, especially the Migrun Settlement near Ramallah. Settlers are preparing themselves to counter that possibility. One Israeli settler explained, "No one can deny that there is an atmosphere of anxiety here. One must be careful because of the situation we live in. We may be forced to evacuate the settlement. You are visiting me in a settlement that has received orders to evacuate, including the 43 families that live here. It appears that we should not expect positive surprises." Migrun settlement post is witnessing a lot of support; dozens of Israelis have come in solidarity with the families who live here. The Rabbinic Settlement Counsel called on settlers to be cautious and avoid violent confrontations with the defense army. They also called on the Prime Minister to reverse his decision to evacuate the settlement and avoid creating confrontations between soldiers and settlers. ; ANN TV, England
