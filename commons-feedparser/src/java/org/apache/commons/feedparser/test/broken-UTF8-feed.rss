    <title>SPOT Review: The Content</title>
    <link>http://www.mobilewhack.com/watch/spot/spot_review_content.html</link>
    <description>
    &lt;a href="http://direct.msn.com/channels/news.aspx"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001540G4/mobilewhack0d-20"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B0001540G4.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" border="0" align="right" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    
I'm spending a little time with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001540G4/mobilewhack-20&quot;&gt;Abacus Wrist Net watch&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft's &lt;a href=&quot;http://direct.msn.com/&quot;&gt;MSN Direct&lt;/a&gt; service for SPOT-enabled devices.  In this, the second installment of an ongoing review, I take a gander at the content, the raison d'etre of these wrist-mounted digital dashboards.

&lt;p /&gt;

While I'm very  much enjoying my SPOT watch and playing with integrating &lt;a href=&quot;http://direct.msn.com/channels/glance.aspx&quot;&gt;glancing&lt;/a&gt; into my daily information gathering, the one downfall is the sparsity of content.  I'm quite frankly rather surprised they didn't hold the roll-out until they had a full complement of the expected sources and usual suspects on-board.  If there's one thing that's critical at this juncture, it's &quot;wow&quot;ing the early adopters with more and richer content than they're expecting.  I'm afraid I found just what I expected. 
&lt;p /&gt;
Yet still I hold out hope of being &quot;wow&quot;ed in the near future.  In that vein -- and hoping the SPOT folks are listening -- I share my impressions, suggestions, and wishes for having this rather intriguing technology and related gizmos deliver on their promise.

&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Must Have More Input&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
Currently MSN Direct features news from only a handful of content providers: AP, Reuters, MSNBC, The Washington Post, Space.com, and some assortment of local news agencies and sites.  Absent are the usual suspects and those who quickly jumped on to the Push bandwagon a few years back: NYT, Wired, The BBC, News.com, et al.  And there's nary a geek source (forgetting the * Technology channels for a moment) in sight.  While they may be targetting business folk, they're shooting themselves in the foot by not providing hot and cold running gadget porn to the early-adopters.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Ten Channel Limit&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
I quickly bumped my head against the ten-channel subscription ceiling.  Perhaps I'm just &lt;a href=&quot;http://direct.msn.com/channels/glance.aspx&quot;&gt;glancing&lt;/a&gt; more often than is expected (or indeed I should), but I actually find myself waiting for new content to put in an appearance.  And MSN Direct doesn't allow you to simply click all of the channel buttons and drink from the fire-hose, such as it is.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Slow News on Weekends&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
My first weekened with the watch saw little new content float by.  Now I know for a fact that stuff happens on weekends.  If the current crop of MSN Direct news sources are geared to Monday through Friday, perhaps they need to find some that work weekends.  Or delve into some of the &quot;lesser&quot; stories that didn't make it to the Front Page.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Overlap, Overlap, and Overlap&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
There's a substantial amount of overlap, especially in the news flashes.  This past weekend saw miriad only-slightly-differently-worded versions of Golden Globe Winner listings and Mars updates.  It'd be nice if MSN Direct took a page from the book of &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt; which provides a headline for first sighting of a story, grouping subsequent versions underneath as updates.  I'd love to be able to subscribe only to the first sightings sometimes and n-levels of updates at other times or on a per-channel basis.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;AOLish Keywords&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
One drive behind MSN Direct on your wrist is to drive you to the site and route you to the appropriate Microsoft destination property.  That being the case, rather than digging through the summaries on my MSN Direct news page trying to match these against the story I just saw on my watch and wanted to follow, something akin to AOL Keywords would be quite an effort-saver.  Visit MSN Direct, type in the alphanumeric code associated with a particular summary, and *foom!*, you're there.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Save and Delete&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
I sure would like to be able to save a particular item for later investigation (aka visiting on the MSN Direct site) while deleting/hiding others which hold little interest for me.  The latter wouldn't be quite as necessary if there were enough incoming news that I didn't keep seeing the same story scrolling by.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Wrist Weather&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
Having never managed the conversion from celsius to fahrenheit, even after all these years, I'm finding great sport in matching the temperature as shown on my SPOT watch to how it actually feels outside: &quot;Hmm, so this is what 65 deg. F feels like!&quot;  For Weather Channel enthusiasts, SPOT's Weather channel alone may very well be worth the price of admission.  (By the way, it's currently 54 deg. F and cloudy.)
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Stop the Stocks, SPOT&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
The stock market closes every evening and weekend like clockwork.  Why then am I fed stock updates 24x7x365?  Surely there should be some way to shut off stock reports in the evening, to be resumed in the morning.  And the same thing for the weekends -- stock silence market-close Friday through market-open Monday.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Spoilers&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
Now this one isn't in any way MSN Direct's fault, but I happened to glance at my watch a few minutes before sitting down to the Golden Globes.  Spoiled the whole event for me, knowing already the winners in about every category, gleaned in just a few seconds of thoughtless glancing.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Get Local&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
I subscribed to my local news source but didn't actually see anything of local interest.  It could have been that they pushed an international or national story which I just assumed was from Reuters or AP.  Surely, though, local stories should be local in content, not just in source.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Goings On&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
I heard some murmerings of local event information, movie times for the next n hours, and so forth.  Now that (assuming reasonable execution) would make this all worth while for me.  Movie times are like my Weather Channel.
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Selected Syndicated Content&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;
While MSN Direct probably won't be taking on their own RSS aggregator any time soon, I look forward to being able to pick and choose from my own collection of daily syndicated feeds.  Perhaps a hack to MSN Messenger IM me stories from my desktop aggregator?  Or a service to do same?
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

While this may at first glance appear to be a list of complaints, I must reiterate that I've been enjoying much of the content already in the offing.  But surely you can't be surprised that an info-hound like myself -- and most likely all of you with SPOTted wrists -- wants more, more, more...

    <title>Book: Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks</title>
    <link>http://www.mobilewhack.com/books/hardware_hacking_projects_for_geeks.html</link>

" border="0" align="right" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    
While only tangentially related to MobileWhack's usual fare, I thought this of interest enough to our readers to give a shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, the start of a cool new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hardwarehks/&quot;&gt;project-based hacking series from O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From How to Hack a Toaster to building Cubicle Intrusion Detection Systems, Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks offers an array of inventive customized electronics projects for the geek who can't help looking at a gadget and wondering how it might be &quot;upgraded.&quot; Beginning with basic hacks, tools, and techniques for those who may not have a background in electronics, the book covers the tools of the hardware hacking trade and basic soldering techniques. Clear step-by-step instructions allow even those with no formal electronics- or hardware-engineering skills to hack real hardware in very clever ways.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You'll find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hardwarehks/toc.pdf&quot;&gt;Table of Contents [PDF]&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hardwarehks/chapter/index.html&quot;&gt;samples&lt;/a&gt; on the O'Reilly site.

&lt;p class=&quot;editorial&quot;&gt;Editor's note: In the interest of full disclosure, it should be noted that I am an editor at O'Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;

In answer to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobilewhack.com/handset/sonyericsson/z600/z600_tmobile_mms.html&quot;&gt;plea for Sony Ericsson Z600 T-Mobile data settings&lt;/a&gt;, I heard from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mondoinfo.com&quot;&gt;Matthew Cowles&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow Z600 onwer who seemed to have things working as they should.  And indeed he did.  And after a few minutes spent in an instant messaging session comparing settings, so did I.  Here, then, are the settings, menu by menu:

    <title>Whispers of a Palm OS 6 Upgrade for OS 5 Handhelds</title>

As mentions of Palm OS 6 abound, the question on the minds of those with recent vintage Palm devices and those poised to buy is whether there's an OS 5-to-OS 6 upgrade path.  The answer currently blowing in the wind is a &quot;yes.&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=6480&quot;&gt;Rumours PalmInfocenter.com&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
New information received by PalmInfocenter indicates that palmOne is currently testing a Palm OS 6 upgrade for select current palmOne handhelds. Devices with Flashable ROM with enough room to spare to fit the new OS, should be able to be upgraded.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>MSN Message a SPOT Watch from Outside the US</title>

SpotStop has a nice &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spotstop.com/default.asp?newsID=26&quot;&gt;workaround&lt;/a&gt; for those outside the US wanting to send an MSN Messenger g'day to a SPOTted friend.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SplaTT, aka Mick Stanic, lives in Australia, but he has friends in the US who have bought SPOT watches. He ran into a unique problem though. How could he get messages to MSN Direct subscribers in the US from Australia? The international version of MSN Messenger doesn’t offer sending to SPOT watch as an option. He’s found a reasonable work around that solves this problem, so now international MSN Messenger users can send messages to SPOT devices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hack involves &quot;moving&quot;--at least so far as your .NET Passport profile is concerned--to the US.

You'll need a Sprint-branded Treo 600 and a Windows box to run the &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt;.  (Is that the sound of Mac users begging, borrowing, and shyly Win32-booting I hear?)

here is the portable geek gym. tiny bluetooth gps velcro'd to my shirt, it talks to a pocket pc, which has a video feed to my sunglasses with lcd screen. also attached, a heart rate monitor, a pedometer, all fed to a health watch via rf, and also a spot watch--to check up on the news and instant messages, optional--my phone, which is used to check email via bluetooth and fed to the glasses which is usually playing the gps feed (maps) or a video. based on my location. it's all really light too, so jogging is still fine.

    <title>(Still) No WiFi For You!</title>
    <link>http://www.mobilewhack.com/pda/palm/accessories/still_no_wifi_for_palm.html</link>
    <description>
    &lt;a href="http://www.sandisk.com/retail_sdwifi.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    
Well colour me surprised, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sandisk.com/retail_sdwifi.html&quot;&gt;SanDisk has once again delayed their Palm WiFi SD card&lt;/a&gt;, now projecting a release of the drivers for Palm OS 5 in Q2 rather than their earlier &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobilewhack.com/pda/palm/accessories/palm_sd_wifi_update.html&quot;&gt;quote of Q1&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p /&gt;
So what's another quarter when it's already been a year :-\.
&lt;p /&gt;
For now, don't forget you can always &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobilewhack.com/pda/palm/apps/net_sharing_mac_to_palm_via_bt.html&quot;&gt;share your laptop/desktop's network connection via Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobileclipper.com&quot;&gt;MobileClipper&lt;/a&gt; is a Web clipping service for your mobile.  Feed it a URL, text before, and text after the clip you're interested in, and the text between is made available for mobile browsing, formatted to fit your phone.  Create, modify, and delete clips at will.  Even password protect them.
&lt;p /&gt;
Yearly subscription is $19.99 (roughly 16 Euro), entitling you to 30 clips at a time, 200 accesses per day.
&lt;p /&gt;
While we here in the US often have hot-and-cold running bandwidth, such a service can really be a time, bandwidth, and cost saver for those paying by the byte.

    <title>Nokia 3620 Available on AT&amp;amp;T Wireless</title>

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000V8FQ0/mobilewhack-20&quot;&gt;Nokia 3620&lt;/a&gt; is now available &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.attwireless.com/personal/products/phonedetails.jhtml?id=1000058&amp;titleNumber=1&quot;&gt;from AT&amp;amp;T Wireless&lt;/a&gt;.  They took out the 3650 a month or so back to make room for this one.  Same features as before, but with the more standard layout for the buttons. 

&lt;p class=&quot;editorial&quot;&gt;Editor's Note: Mobile-review has a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobile-review.com/review/nokia-3660-en.shtml&quot;&gt;review of the 3660&lt;/a&gt;, the world-phone version of the 3620 mentioned above.  The two obvious changes since the 3650 are the new TFT screen (65k vs. 4k) and (more) standard keypad layout -- gone is the birth-control keypad we've come to know and... love(?).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p /&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000V8FQ0/mobilewhack0d-20"&gt;Buy from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; |

    <title>Z600 Accessories, Accessories, Accessories</title>
    <link>http://www.mobilewhack.com/handset/sonyericsson/z600/z600_accessories.html</link>
    <description>
    &lt;a href="http://www.flashenabled.com/nimages/z600collection.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.mobilewhack.com/images/handset/sonyericsson/z600/z600gamepadsm.jpg" border="0" align="right" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    
although i am using a moto smartphone for my mobile phone, i sometimes switch over to the z600. why? accessories. gamepad, bluetooth car, bluetooth headset, bluetoothmp3 player, flashlight, laser beam. it's cool stuff. accessories make it. the paul smith cover helps too.

&lt;p class=&quot;editorial&quot;&gt;Editor's note: Be sure to take a gander at PT's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flashenabled.com/nimages/z600collection.jpg&quot;&gt;Z600 accessory gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;editorial&quot;&gt;I must admit, much to my own surprise, mind, that I've come to adore my Z600. The fit and finish is beyond compare.  And the Sony Ericsson accessories really make the difference.  Snap a laser pointer on to your Z600, hook into your Mac via Bluetooth using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://homepage.mac.com/jonassalling/Shareware/Clicker/&quot;&gt;Salling Clicker&lt;/a&gt;, and you've a presentation tool in a phone.  And my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000TR77U/mobilewhack-20&quot;&gt;Jabra BT headset&lt;/a&gt; -- despite making me look like a Bajoran -- means mobile meetings free of neck strain (yes, I know this isn't specific to the Z600).  And the lion's share of the accessories (Gamepad aside) work as expected with your older T68i, should you be considering an upgrade but have concerns about all the $$ you sunk into those doodads.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Screen Cleaner</title>

    &lt;img src="http://www.mobilewhack.com/images/handset/accessories/screen_cleaner.jpg" border="0" align="right" /&gt;
    
Someone asked what that &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=minnie+pearl&amp;btnG=Google+Search&quot;&gt;Minnie Pearl&lt;/a&gt;-like label was dangling from my cellphone and Palm.  
&lt;p /&gt;
Glad you asked :-)  
&lt;p /&gt;
It's one of the greatest inventions of the modern age -- for some anal-retentive definition of greatest, that is.  It's a screen cleaner, a tethered bit of soft mock-suede material meant for cleaning ear and cheek goo from your handset screen after use.
&lt;p /&gt;
I first saw one hanging from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flashenabled.com/&quot;&gt;PT's&lt;/a&gt; phone.  It's apparently a common accoutrement in Japan.  I'd never seen one before but knew it was meant for me.  A couple of days later I happened across a basket-full at Samsung's CES booth and (with permission, of course) stuffed my stuff-sack with the little beauties.
&lt;p /&gt;
Strike that from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lazyweb.org/&quot;&gt;LazyWeb&lt;/a&gt; list!

It seems to have a decent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.symbianwiki.com/Series60Index?v=15nw&quot;&gt;Series 60 section&lt;/a&gt;.  With a bit of love, this site can become an excellent resource.

    <title>MMS/WAP on T-Mobile with a Z600?</title>
    <link>http://www.mobilewhack.com/handset/sonyericsson/z600/z600_tmobile_mms.html</link>
    <description>
    &lt;img src="http://www.mobilewhack.com/images/handset/sonyericsson/z600/z600.jpg" border="0" align="right" /&gt;
    
Anyone been able to send MMS messages on T-Mobile from a Sony Ericsson Z600?  Or consistently use the WAP browser to, well, browse WAP?
&lt;p /&gt;
While it seems the settings copied from a T610/616 should just plain work, that just doesn't seem to be the case.
&lt;p /&gt;
The only thing I've found thus far is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.howardforums.com/archive/topic/230107-1.html&quot;&gt;this HowardForums thread&lt;/a&gt; populated by others having the same problem (ain't Google grand?).  While I'm inclined to just settle in and wait for T-Mobile to throw the big Z600 switch, I hear intermittent reports of (but no verification of) folks who've managed to find the right combo of settings... thus my &quot;wish&quot; post.

    <title>Alternative MMS with Zidango</title>
    <link>http://www.mobilewhack.com/messaging/mms/zidango.html</link>
    <description>
    &lt;a href="http://www.zidango.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    
Carriers in the United States haven't figured out how to make it possible to send MMS messages amongst each other. If you don't want to keep waiting for them to figure it all out, you could give some scratch to people that did. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zidango.com&quot;&gt;Zidango&lt;/a&gt; boasts the ability to send an MMS message to devices on all carriers that do MMS, such as Cingular, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T Wireless.
&lt;p /&gt;
Zidango even supports the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zidango.com/help.jsp?nr=#100&quot;&gt;Nokia 6600 for T-Mobile US&lt;/a&gt; users currently locked out of sending MMS messages.
&lt;p /&gt;
They also some other neat features, such as pre-made MMS messages, and an MMS Album keeping copies of sent and received MMS messages.
