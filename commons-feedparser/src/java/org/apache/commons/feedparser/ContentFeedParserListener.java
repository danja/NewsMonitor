     * @param type (Atom) Content constructs MAY have a "type" attribute, whose
     * value indicates the media type of the content. When present, this attribute's
     * value MUST be a registered media type [RFC2045]. If not present, its value
     * MUST be considered to be "text/plain".  3.1.2 "mode" Attribute
     * 
     * @param mode (Atom) Content constructs MAY have a "mode" attribute, whose
     * value indicates the method used to encode the content. When present, this
     * attribute's value MUST be listed below. If not present, its value MUST be
     * considered to be "xml".
     * 
     * "xml":
     * 
     * A mode attribute with the value "xml" indicates that the element's content is
     * inline xml (for example, namespace-qualified XHTML).
     * 
     * "escaped":
     * 
     * A mode attribute with the value "escaped" indicates that the element's
     * content is an escaped string. Processors MUST unescape the element's content
     * before considering it as content of the indicated media type.
     * 
     * "base64":
     * 
     * A mode attribute with the value "base64" indicates that the element's content is
     * base64-encoded [RFC2045]. Processors MUST decode the element's content before
     * considering it as content of the the indicated media type.
     * 
     * @param format (RSS 1.0 mod_content) Required. An empty element with an
     * rdf:resource attribute that points to a URI representing the format of the
     * content:item. Suggested best practice is to use the list of RDDL natures.
     *
     * @param encoding (RSS 1.0 mod_content) Optional. An empty element with an
     * rdf:resource attribute that points to a URI representing the encoding of the
     * content:item. An encoding is a reversable method of including content within
     * the RSS file.
     *
     * @param value String value of the found content.  if this is Base64
     * encoded content we do NOT decode the value but return it as a string.
     * This is done because the content might be binary and returning as a
     * string would be invalid.
     * 
     * @param isSummary True if this is just a summary of the content and not
     * the full content.  This is only known for Atom feeds.
