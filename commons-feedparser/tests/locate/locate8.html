   o  Element names are not case-sensitive.  For example, clients MUST
      treat <link ...> the same as <LINK ...>
   o  Attribute names are not case-sensitive.  For example, clients MUST
      treat <link rel="alternate" ...> the same as <link REL="alternate"
      ...>.
   o  Attributes may appear in any order; the order MUST NOT be
      considered significant.
   o  Attribute values MUST be one of the following: enclosed in double
      quotes, enclosed in single quotes, or not enclosed in quotes at
      all.
   o  Attribute values MAY contain leading or trailing spaces, or both.
      Clients MUST ignore both leading and trailing spaces in attribute
      valuess.  For example, clients MUST treat all of the following the
      same way: <link rel="alternate" ...>, <link rel="alternate " ...>,
      <link rel=" alternate" ...>, and <link rel=" alternate " ...>.
