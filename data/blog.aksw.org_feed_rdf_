<p>On <strong>Friday, March 14, at 10.00 a.m. in room P901</strong>, visiting researchers <a href="http://www.den.nl/pagina/297/medewerkers/">Tine van Nierop and Rein van &#8216;t Veer</a> from the <a href="http://erfgoedenlocatie.nl/">E&amp;L</a> will discuss, amongst several other semantic web initiatives in the Netherlands, two  different projects: Heritage &amp; Location  (www.erfgoedenlocatie.nl) and PiLOD 2.0 (www.pilod.nl). Heritage &amp;  Location assembles linked geospatial data from all possible heritage  institutions and discloses it in geotemporal semantic applications.  PiLOD (Platform implementation Linked Open Data) is a sector-independent  initiative for any institution or individual wanting to explore the  possibilities of the semantic web.</p>

<p>John McCrae is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Bielefeld in Bielefeld, Germany. He is currently working in Prof. Philipp Cimiano&#8217;s group, AG Semantic Computing. His research interests include the following: Ontologies and the lexicon-ontology interface, Collaborative development and publishing of language resources, Linked data and the Semantic Web, Machine translation and multilingualism, Machine learning methods for NLP, Probabilistic inference.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Abstract</h3>
<p>There are a large number of ontologies currently available on the Semantic Web. However, in order to exploit them within natural language processing applications, more linguistic information than can be represented in current Semantic Web standards is required. Further, there are a large number of lexical resources available representing a wealth of linguistic information, but this data exists in various formats and is difficult to link to ontologies and other resources. We present a model we call lemon that supports the sharing of terminological and lexicon resources on the Semantic Web as well as their linking to the existing semantic representations provided by ontologies. We demonstrate that lemon can succinctly represent existing lexical resources and in combination with standard NLP tools we can easily generate new lexica for domain ontologies according to the lemon model. We demonstrate that by combining generated and existing lexica we can collaboratively develop rich lexical descriptions of ontology entities. We also show that the adoption of Semantic Web standards can provide added value for lexicon models by supporting a rich axiomatization of linguistic categories that can be used to constrain the usage of the model and to perform consistency checks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A major  goal is to find best practices to be applied in future JavaScript  projects of the AKSW group and agree on tools to utilize, leading to a  better chance reuse and understanding.</p>
<p>Every participant is  invited to present tools and libraries she/he used so far and point out  major advantages and drawbacks. To set up an agenda everyone interested  to contribute should add her/his topic to the suggested agenda at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qhxsf6g">http://tinyurl.com/qhxsf6g</a> together with her/his name. The final agenda will be derived from this  document. Please design your presentations and prepare your material in a  way so that participants can try out things immediately out on their  notebooks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Participation is free. Bringing your laptop is recommended.</p>
