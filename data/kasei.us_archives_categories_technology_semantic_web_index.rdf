    <title>IRI Encoding Troubles</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I was tracking down a <a href="https://github.com/kasei/perlrdf/issues/85">bug in RDF::Trine</a> submitted by Jonas Smedegaard relating to the handling of unicode in IRIs. The bug involved the decoding of a punycode URI (which was an inadvertent "feature" that snuck in to RDF::Trine due to a feature in URI):</p>

<p><code>http://www.xn--hestebedgrd-58a.dk/</code></p>

<p>Strangely, this URI was being treated differently than other punycode URIs (e.g. <code>http://xn--df-oiy.ws/</code>), causing encoding errors in a completely different part of the code.</p>

<p>Upon investigating the problem, I determined that the punycode decoding code in the <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/URI">URI</a> package treats punycode URIs differently depending on if they contain any unicode codepoints that cannot be represented in the Latin-1 encoding. For IRIs with all low-codepoint characters such as <code>http://www.hestebedgÃÂ¥rd.dk/</code>, the perl value returned by the <code>URI-&gt;as_iri</code> method is a Latin-1 encoded string. High-codepoint IRIs such as <code>http://Ã¢ÂÂªdf.ws/</code> are returned as UTF-8 encoded values. This difference caused problems when the values were subsequently passed into <a href="http://librdf.org/">Redland</a>'s C code that expected UTF-8 values.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/GAAS">Gisle Aas</a>, the author of <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/URI">URI</a>, noted in <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=86064">the bug report</a> I submitted on this issue, the simple fix is to call <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/utf8.html">utf8::upgrade</a> on values returned by <code>URI-&gt;as_iri</code>. While I believe this should be done in the <code>as_iri</code> method (as it is documented to return "a Unicode string"), until that is the case I hope this post might save some time and trouble for the next person to come across this issue.</p>

    <title>Moving perlrdf to Moose</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week I spent a few days at the Preikestolen Mountain Lodge at the <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/mtmh2012/">Moving to Moose hackathon</a>. I got to meet some great people from the perl5 and perl6 communities, hack on the perlrdf toolkit, and see a couple of <a href="http://sartak.org/talks/yapc-eu-2012/role-usage-patterns/">great talks</a>.</p>

<p class="blogimage"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/7866876372/" title="Lysefjord Cairn"><img src="/archives/2012/08/30/cairn.jpg" alt="Lysefjord Cairn || Panasonic DMC-GF1 | Lumix G 20/F1.7 | 1/50s | f13 | ISO100" title="Lysefjord Cairn || Panasonic DMC-GF1 | Lumix G 20/F1.7 | 1/50s | f13 | ISO100" width="400" height="267" /></a><br/>Lysefjord Cairn</p>

<p>Along with other members of the <a href="http://www.perlrdf.org/">perlrdf</a> community, I worked on updating our RDF toolkit (<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/RDF::Trine">RDF::Trine</a>) to use the <a href="http://moose.iinteractive.com/">Moose</a> object system. <a href="http://chris.prather.org">Chris Prather</a> helped us settle on a design that will simplify code, allow for easy implementation of new parsers, serializers, and stores, and provide a way for implementors to greatly improve the quality of SPARQL query plans produced by RDF::Query.</p>

<p><a href="http://ruben.verborgh.org">Ruben Verborgh</a> did some amazing optimization work (with help from <a href="https://twitter.com/sartak">Shawn Moore</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/perldtrace">dtrace</a>) on the pure-perl Turtle and N-Triples parser that yielded two orders of magnitude improvement in parsing speed on some large inputs.</p>

<p><a href="http://tobyinkster.co.uk">Toby Inkster</a> started converted the classes for nodes and statements to use Moose.
<a href="https://github.com/kba/">Konstantin Baierer</a> worked on modeling the type system in Moose allowing coercion of common objects and unboxed types to their RDF object equivalents. Together they went on to improve the extensibility of the parsing and serializing code, which will make it easier to support custom file formats in the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/">Kjetil Kjernsmo</a> refactored several modules meant to manage XML namespaces into the new <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/URI::NamespaceMap">URI::NamespaceMap</a> package.</p>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m thrilled with the progress we made, and think the new design will allow us to keep improving our code and growing as a community.

<p>On Tuesday, I presented my work (done with <a href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~weavej3/index.xhtml">Jesse Weaver</a>) on <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/mq0x5238661u4526/">HTTP caching of SPARQL query results</a>.

<p>There were presentations on two interesting projects for benchmarking SPARQL systems. The <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/DBPSB">DBpedia SPARQL Benchmark</a> (which won the <a href="http://blog.aksw.org/2011/dbpedia-sparql-benchmark-paper-wins-iswc2011-best-paper-award/" title="DBpedia SPARQL Benchmark paper wins ISWC2011 best-paper award">best research paper award</a>) is a new SPARQL benchmark based on real-world data and queries from the DBPedia endpoint. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fbench/">FedBench</a>, meanwhile, attempts to benchmark federated SPARQL query evaluation using a set of both real and synthetic datasets (including a subset of the LOD cloud and SP2B). With the relatively impoverished state of existing SPARQL benchmarks, I'm thrilled to see new work going on in this area.</p>

<p>I spent quite a bit of time with people from Talis, DFKI, and DERI, and only wish there had been more time for the great conversations that took place at and after the conference.

    <title>Back from ISWC</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Trying to get back into the habit of posting here. I'm just back from two weeks of Semantic Web-related travel. First was roughly a week in northern Virginia for the International Semantic Web Conference, followed by a meeting of the SPARQL working group at the W3C Technical Plenary in Santa Clara, California. Lots of good stuff going on recently; I've tried to highlight some of it below.</p>

<p class="blogimage"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/4055714142/" title="Jesse's BTC Presentation"><img src="/archives/2009/11/08/jesse_btc.jpg" alt="Jesse's BTC Presentation || Nikon D200 | Nikkor 35mm f/2D | 1/160s | f2 | ISO320" title="Jesse's BTC Presentation || Nikon D200 | Nikkor 35mm f/2D | 1/160s | f2 | ISO320" width="400" height="267" /></a><br/>Jesse presenting our Billion Triples Challenge work</p>

<p>Our work on <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Scalable_RDF_query_processing_on_clusters_and_supercomputers">RDF querying on supercomputers</a> was recieved with much interest at the <a href="http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-517/">SSWS workshop</a>. Lots of good questions were asked about the approach, and I hope I provided reasonable answers to them (though I think I could have done a better job in presenting the techniques to avoid some of the resulting confusion). The big news was that our <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Scalable_Reduction_of_Large_Datasets_to_Interesting_Subsets">Semantic Web Challenge entry</a> (combining the parallel RDF query work, <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Scalable_Reduction_of_Large_Datasets_to_Interesting_Subsets">Jesse's parallel RDFS materialization</a> work, and Medha's <a href="http://CEUR-WS.org/Vol-517/ssws09-paper3.pdf">BitMat</a> work) won in the Billion Triples track.</p>

<p>Jesse and I had some good conversations with Jacopo Urbani about his MapReduce-based reasoning system, its similarity to Jesse's reasoning work, and the overlap with the parallel query answering work (in the context of extending their systems to handle more expressive reasoning).</p>

<p>Members of the SPARQL working group had what I thought was a good panel Q&amp;A at ISWC about what's coming in SPARQL 1.1. There was some good input (and criticism) of what we've got so far, and I hope we can follow up on many of the points made including the issues of efficient federated querying and atomicity versus full ACID trasactions (we discussed some of these issues at the meeting in Santa Clara).</p>

<p>The RDF indexing in <a href="http://parliament.semwebcentral.org/">Parliament</a> (also presented at SSWS) looked interesting (especially the "average case analysis" that explains some of the tradeoffs of the design and why the design is good for many real-world datasets). Unfortunately, the SSWS proceedings seem to link mistakenly to a draft version of the paper. I've put some more thoughts on Parliament and its impact on our clustered RDF query engine on the Tetherless World blog: <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/weblog/2009/11/08/parliament-storage-density-and-napkin-math/">Parliament, storage density, and napkin math</a>.</p>

<p class="blogimage"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/4076593768/" title="Golden Gate Bridge"><img src="/archives/2009/11/08/golden_gate.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge || iPhone 3G | f2.8" title="Golden Gate Bridge || iPhone 3G | f2.8" width="400" height="300" /></a><br/>Golden Gate Bridge</p>

<p>Leigh Dodds produced a good looking vocabulary at <a href="http://vocamp.org/wiki/VoCampDCOctober2009">VoCamp DC</a> for <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/blog/2009/11/describing-sparql-extension-functions/">Describing SPARQL Extension Functions</a>. Seems like it would mesh nicely with the SPARQL service descriptions we're working on for SPARQL 1.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/132">Expressing Statistics with RDF</a> does a nice job of explaining how to use the <a href="http://sw.joanneum.at/scovo/schema.html">SCOVO</a> vocabulary to describe statistical data. I've been using SCOVO to encode statistical descriptions for the data.gov datasets with some success (though I hear the voiD folks are working on a less verbose way to do dataset descriptions).</p>

<p><a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/silk/">Silk</a> looks like a great tool to do linking between datasets, and something I hope we can look at for the <a href="http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/">data.gov RDF work</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, while sitting in on the SPARQL meeting in Santa Clara, Dave Beckett designed a very nice diagram explaining the <a href="http://www.dajobe.org/2009/11/sparql11/">SPARQL 1.1 Query Execution Sequence</a>. It captures the conceptual ordering of the operations involved in a SPARQL 1.1 query (including aggregates) and I assume maps nicely to many actual implementation (certainly it does to mine).</p>

<p>Our work on <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Scalable_RDF_query_processing_on_clusters_and_supercomputers">RDF querying on supercomputers</a> was recieved with much interest at the <a href="http://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Publications/CEUR-WS/Vol-517/">SSWS workshop</a>. Lots of good questions were asked about the approach, and I hope I provided reasonable answers to them (though I think I could have done a better job in presenting the techniques to avoid some of the resulting confusion). The big news was that our <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Scalable_Reduction_of_Large_Datasets_to_Interesting_Subsets">Semantic Web Challenge entry</a> (combining the parallel RDF query work, <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/wiki/Scalable_Reduction_of_Large_Datasets_to_Interesting_Subsets">Jesse's parallel RDFS materialization</a> work, and Medha's <a href="http://CEUR-WS.org/Vol-517/ssws09-paper3.pdf">BitMat</a> work) won in the Billion Triples track.</p>

<p>Jesse and I had some good conversations with Jacopo Urbani about his MapReduce-based reasoning system, its similarity to Jesse's reasoning work, and the overlap with the parallel query answering work (in the context of extending their systems to handle more expressive reasoning).</p>

<p>Members of the SPARQL working group had what I thought was a good panel Q&amp;A at ISWC about what's coming in SPARQL 1.1. There was some good input (and criticism) of what we've got so far, and I hope we can follow up on many of the points made including the issues of efficient federated querying and atomicity versus full ACID trasactions (we discussed some of these issues at the meeting in Santa Clara).</p>

<p>The RDF indexing in <a href="http://parliament.semwebcentral.org/">Parliament</a> (also presented at SSWS) looked interesting (especially the "average case analysis" that explains some of the tradeoffs of the design and why the design is good for many real-world datasets). Unfortunately, the SSWS proceedings seem to link mistakenly to a draft version of the paper. I've put some more thoughts on Parliament and its impact on our clustered RDF query engine on the Tetherless World blog: <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/weblog/2009/11/08/parliament-storage-density-and-napkin-math/">Parliament, storage density, and napkin math</a>.</p>

<p class="blogimage"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/4076593768/" title="Golden Gate Bridge"><img src="/archives/2009/11/08/golden_gate.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge || iPhone 3G | f2.8" title="Golden Gate Bridge || iPhone 3G | f2.8" width="400" height="300" /></a><br/>Golden Gate Bridge</p>

<p>Leigh Dodds produced a good looking vocabulary at <a href="http://vocamp.org/wiki/VoCampDCOctober2009">VoCamp DC</a> for <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/blog/2009/11/describing-sparql-extension-functions/">Describing SPARQL Extension Functions</a>. Seems like it would mesh nicely with the SPARQL service descriptions we're working on for SPARQL 1.1.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/132">Expressing Statistics with RDF</a> does a nice job of explaining how to use the <a href="http://sw.joanneum.at/scovo/schema.html">SCOVO</a> vocabulary to describe statistical data. I've been using SCOVO to encode statistical descriptions for the data.gov datasets with some success (though I hear the voiD folks are working on a less verbose way to do dataset descriptions).</p>

<p><a href="http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/bizer/silk/">Silk</a> looks like a great tool to do linking between datasets, and something I hope we can look at for the <a href="http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/">data.gov RDF work</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, while sitting in on the SPARQL meeting in Santa Clara, Dave Beckett designed a very nice diagram explaining the <a href="http://www.dajobe.org/2009/11/sparql11/">SPARQL 1.1 Query Execution Sequence</a>. It captures the conceptual ordering of the operations involved in a SPARQL 1.1 query (including aggregates) and I assume maps nicely to many actual implementation (certainly it does to mine).</p>

    <title>New RDF::Query</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I finally found some time to wrap up the state of RDF::Query, and get things ready for a release. It's the first release in almost a year, and while the user facing API is mostly unchanged, lots of things have changed under the hood. There's too much to detail here (just compiling the changelog took me a couple of days, and it was mostly a firehose approach without the effort of summarizing anything), but I'll highlight a few things I'm excited about, (especially in the context of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/wiki/Main_Page">current DAWG work</a> to update SPARQL):</p>

<ul>
	<li>SPARQL syntax extensions:
		<ul>
			<li>Support for UNSAID keyword, allowing much simpler syntax for queries with negation.</li>
			<li>Support for <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/05/SPARQLfed/">FeDeRate BINDINGS</a> syntax, generalizing the ability to pre-bind certain variables.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>The new (fairly rudimentary) cost model code will give significant speedup on some queries.</li>
	<li>The use of proper query plan objects allows queries to be built programmatically (a feature requested by KjetilK).</li>
</ul>

<p>The new version, 2.100, is <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-Query/">available from CPAN</a>, and ongoing development is <a href="http://github.com/kasei/perlrdf/">available from github</a>.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Tenerife</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>So, I'm back from <a href="http://www.eswc2008.org/">ESWC</a> in Tenerife. I was hoping to make a post once I arrived about going to ESWC, and with updates on papers, discussions, photos, etc., but events seem to have conspired against me.</p>

<p class="blogimage"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/2562148152/" title="From the hotel bar"><img src="http://kasei.us/archives/2008/06/09/hotel.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>

<p>I was scheduled to leave Albany on Saturday, May 31<sup>st</sup>. I was meant to fly to Philadelphia, then to London, and finally on to Tenerife. Unfortunately, super cell thunderstorms were headed for Albany, and my first flight was delayed. This caused a cascade of problems, resulting in my arriving in Tenerife not on Sunday night, but on Tuesday afternoon. I ended up missing entirely the workshop I was meant to present at, and half of the first day of the conference.</p>

<p>I did get to spend an interesting night in the Gatwick <a href="http://www.yotel.com/">Yotel</a> (click through to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/2547440568/">Flickr</a> to read more about it and see photo annotations):</p>

<p class="blogimage"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/2547440568/" title="Yotel Gatwick Capsule"><img src="http://kasei.us/archives/2008/06/09/yotel.jpg" alt="Yotel Gatwick Capsule" width="266" height="400" /></a></p>

<p>Luckily, during the 2.5 days I <em>was</em> at the conference, I caught some interesting talks, had some great discussions with people about my research (and theirs), and enjoyed the Canaries. I'll be posting more on the technical bits in a future post (probably on the <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/weblog/">Tetherless World weblog</a>). There was no email or newsreader checking at the conference, as the hotel network had about 99% packet loss (when you could get an IP lease at all).</p>

<p class="blogimage"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kasei/2562149764/" title="Dan and Chris"><img src="http://kasei.us/archives/2008/06/09/dan_and_chris.jpg" alt="Dan and Chris" width="400" height="266" /></a></p>

<p>The trip home was almost as bad as the trip to the Canaries. I had to leave for the airport at 01:00 after a full day of driving around the island, and total travel time was roughly 28 hours. After sleeping in the Tenerife, Madrid, and Philadelphia airports, and a ~3 hour delay of my final flight, I finally made it home on Saturday night.</p>

    <title>RDF::Query 2.000</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kasei.us/code/rdf-query/">RDF::Query</a> 2.000 <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gwilliams/RDF-Query-2.000/">hit the CPAN</a> a few days ago, and I thought I'd post a quick announcement. I already hinted at some of the changes in the previous post about <a href="http://kasei.us/archives/2008/03/09/rdfquery">beta releases</a>, but to sum it up, here are some of the important bits:</p>

<ul>
	<li>RDF::Query now passes all SPARQL syntax tests and all but 4 eval tests (all four of which are, I believe, optional tests). The relevant EARL reports are here: <a href="http://kasei.us/code/rdf-query/2.000/earl-syntax.ttl" title="EARL results for SPARQL syntax tests on RDF::Query 2.000">syntax</a>, <a href="http://kasei.us/code/rdf-query/2.000/earl-eval.ttl" title="EARL results for SPARQL eval tests on RDF::Query 2.000">eval</a>.</li>
	<li>The API for executing a query has been changed to be more clean and consistent. Most importantly, the return value from the <code>execute</code> method is now always a <code>RDF::Trine::Iterator</code> object, and for binding results (what you get back from a SELECT query) the things the iterator returns are now hashrefs mapping variable names to <code>RDF::Trine::Node</code> objects.</li>
	<li>RDF::Query now provides an extended SPARQL grammar (requested by the name 'sparqlp' in the constructor [suggestions for better names welcome]) that provides access to some new functionality. Currently, the main thing it exposes is access to <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/ARQ/service.html">ARQ-like</a> <code>SERVICE</code> blocks, allowing basic query federation. Under the hood, these federated queries try to make use of some work I've been doing on efficient federation, identity reasoning, and Bloom filters (more on that later). In the coming months, I'm hoping to add more features that will be exposed through this new parser to try out some new ideas and to keep pace with some of the interesting work being done in other projects (see the <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SPARQL/Extensions">SPARQL Extensions</a> ESW wiki page for some ideas).</li>
	<li>Under the hood, there have been tremendous code changes since the 1.x line of RDF::Query. The code has been vastly improved, cleaned, and fixed so that it's easier to read and modify. Perhaps most importantly, it's now much easier to extend the system to do new things (like extending the syntax and adding new evaluation classes such as <code>SERVICE</code>).</li>

    <title>RDF::Query 2.0 beta</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been posting some beta release of RDF::Query 2.0 to CPAN, the latest being <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gwilliams/RDF-Query-2.000_05/">2.000_05</a>.  I've had <a href="http://www.kanzaki.com/">masaka</a> (as the most vocal [and helpful] user of RDF::Query) test some of the previous releases, and I think things have mostly stabilized in the past few weeks. I think this is getting close to a final release, but would welcome any feedback from other interested parties before I do that.</p>

<p>This new release has some important API changes which I've tried to note in the documentation, but I'd be particularly interested in any comments people might have about gaps in the documentation, both regarding changes from 1.x to 2.x as well as for general use.</p>

<p>Since the last release (1.501), I've split off a lot of the code into the independent <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gwilliams/RDF-Trine/">RDF::Trine</a> package. This is meant to be a general RDF framework (akin to RDF::Core), but more attuned to the issues related to the requirements of querying. RDF::Trine is a requirement of RDF::Query 2.000 (whether your underlying data is stored in RDF::Trine, Redland, or RDF::Core) and its node and statement classes are used as return values from query execution.</p>

<p>So anyone who's interested, please feel free to download the beta, give it a spin and let me know how it goes.</p>]]></description>

    <title>RDF::Query updates</title>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned in the last post that I've made a change in RDF::Query that will break backwards compatibility.  The change involves the values (bindings) that are returned from a <code>SELECT</code> query. Previously, a query might look like this:</p>

<code>
<p>
my $query = new RDF::Query ( 'SELECT ?s ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' );<br/>
my $iterator = $query->execute( $model );<br/>
while (my $row = $iterator->()) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($s, $o) = @$row;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br/>
}
</p>

<p></code></p>

<p>The iterator was only guaranteed to be a CODE reference, and the values it returned were ARRAY references containing the bindings. This code would now look like this:</p>

<code>
<p>
my $query = new RDF::Query ( 'SELECT ?s ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' );<br/>
my $iterator = $query->execute( $model );<br/>
while (my $row = $iterator->next()) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my $s = $row->{s};<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my $o = $row->{o};<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br/>
}
</p>

    <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned in the last post that I've made a change in RDF::Query that will break backwards compatibility.  The change involves the values (bindings) that are returned from a <code>SELECT</code> query. Previously, a query might look like this:</p>

<code>
<p>
my $query = new RDF::Query ( 'SELECT ?s ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' );<br/>
my $iterator = $query->execute( $model );<br/>
while (my $row = $iterator->()) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($s, $o) = @$row;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br/>
}
</p>

<p></code></p>

<p>The iterator was only guaranteed to be a CODE reference, and the values it returned were ARRAY references containing the bindings. This code would now look like this:</p>

<code>
<p>
my $query = new RDF::Query ( 'SELECT ?s ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }' );<br/>
my $iterator = $query->execute( $model );<br/>
while (my $row = $iterator->next()) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my $s = $row->{s};<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;my $o = $row->{o};<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br/>
}
</p>
