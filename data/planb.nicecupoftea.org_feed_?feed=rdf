	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chromecasts are Â£40-odd quid on Amazon.co.uk, and we&#8217;re interested in using them at work, so I got one to look at. Here are the bits you get in the box:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/chromecast.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/chromecast.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Chromecast pieces form the box" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-349" /></a></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a walk through of the setup using Mac OS X (10.8.4) and a Samsung 6000-series TV.</p>
<p>Overall &#8211; the setup was a bit longer and more involved then I&#8217;d anticipated, and it&#8217;s not really clear what&#8217;s going on, unless like me you&#8217;re working with a device that does more or less the same thing. The setup worked almost perfectly though and the result is impressive. </p>
<p>The way the setup works is that the device broadcasts a wifi network, you connect to it after some visual checking (it does the connecting automatically via an app), and then you tell it your wifi connection details &#8211; the app gathers the names of wifi networks but you tell it the password. We are doing the same thing in a manual way in <a href="http://radiodan.github.io">Radiodan</a> and the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardYun">Arduino YÃºn</a> does something similar. My colleague reports that it is smoother on an Android app, and I guess Apple laptops probably are not the key target devices, since the functionality is like Airplay.</p>
<p>You need to install an app for the setup and an extension in Chrome to &#8216;cast&#8217; things; for YouTube and a few other sites you cast directly in the page, which as I understand it, makes the Chromecast device make a separate call to the site for the best version of the video. For other things you just get the whole browser tab, including fullscreen if you like. The Chromecast extension can</p>
<ul>
<li>access your data on all websites</li>
<li>access your tabs and browsing activity</li>
<li>manage network connections</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure what those mean precisely yet. </p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be logged into Google to set it up or use it, and I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Here are the instructions:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/photo.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/photo.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Chromecast box - instructions" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-331" /></a></p>
<p>You put the chromecast into the HDMI socket and plug it into the mains via a mini USB. Flip through sources on the TV and find the screen that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/sxzoi.jpeg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/sxzoi.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Chromecast set me up screen on the TV" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-317" /></a></p>
<p>At this point we spotted a new wifi network, &#8216;Chromecast4827&#8242;.</p>
<p>On the computer (Mac OS X) you go to <a href="http://google.com/chromecast/setup">the Chromecast setup link</a> and download and install an app:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8085.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8085.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Mac OS X screenshot of Chromecast installation app" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-318" /></a></p>
<p>When you run it it asks you to say which Chromecast you are installing &#8211; I forgot to take a screenshot of that bit.</p>
<p>Then the app is obviously connecting to the wifi network. The twee &#8216;Back in a snap&#8217; makes me want to lightly punch someone, but that&#8217;s all part of the current infestation of corporate cutesiness, so I guess I have to live with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8087.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8087.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Screenshot of app connecting the Chromecast to the wifi network" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-323" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have to change the input, this code just appeared&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8089.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8089.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Screenshot of app showing the code" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-321" /></a></p>
<p>&#8230;on the TV:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/k25lf.jpeg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/k25lf.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="The code on the TV" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-322" /></a></p>
<p>Then you wait a while for it to download software and restart.</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/atoof.jpeg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/atoof.jpeg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Chromecast on the TV downloading updates" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-320" /></a><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8091.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8091.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Screenshot of app explaining that the Chromecast is downloading updates" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-319" /></a></p>
<p>TV says &#8216;ready to cast&#8217;:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8093.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8093.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="TV says ready to cast" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-337" /></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Continue&#8217; on the app, then we get &#8216;start using chromecast&#8217;: </p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8094.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8094.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="App success screen" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-326" /></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Start using Chromecast&#8217; takes you to a link in Chrome.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hang in there&#8217; *light punch*</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8095.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8095.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Link to extension in Chrome" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-325" /></a></p>
<p>Google Cast extension wants to know your brain:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8096.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8096.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Google Cast extension permissions requested" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-324" /></a></p>
<p>Once the extension was installed, I watched the &#8216;how to&#8217; video locally &#8211; </p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/photo-18.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/photo-18.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Chromecast how-to video" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-361" /></a></p>
<p>- then tried to play it remotely &#8211; it didn&#8217;t work. </p>
<p>A different YouTube video worked, though it grumbled when I pressed the extensions &#8216;cast&#8217; button and prefered me to use the one in the YouTube page:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8098.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8098.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="YouTube video - suggesting use of the in-page button" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-329" /></a><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8099.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_8099.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="YouTube video working on the TV" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-328" /></a></p>
<p>The nice thing about doing it like this is you can open a new tab locally and it carries on playing.</p>
<p>iPlayer worked by casting using the extension &#8211; in full screen it looked pretty good:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/photo1.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/photo1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="iPlayer on Chromecast" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-340" /></a></p>
<p>- although in full screen you can&#8217;t open another tab.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/316/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/316/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=planb.nicecupoftea.org&#038;blog=7954761&#038;post=316&#038;subd=libbymiller&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since it was raining this afternoon, I did a couple of things that have been bugging me for a while. Here are some quick notes.</p>
<h4>GiffGaff &#8216;adult&#8217; filter</h4>
<p><a href="http://giffgaff.com">GiffGaff</a> is a really great pay-as-you go mobile provider for people like me who use a lot of data (the Â£12 per month option gives you unlimited data and I can use the minutes for confcalls). However, it runs on the O2 network who use a blacklist for &#8216;adult&#8217; content. Mostly when I hit a blocked page it is a random blog I have arrived at via Twitter, and it is not clear why it is &#8216;adult&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know where these lists come from, nor how sites end up on one. As <a href="http://milenapopova.eu/2013/07/porn-blocking---a-survivors-perspective.html">this powerful survivor post</a> and <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/2013/sleepwalking-into-censorship">this ORG post on the Cameron firewall</a> illustrate, it is far from obvious how to make the distinction between the kinds of sites that might help people who are victims trying to find out more, and the kinds of site that kids shouldn&#8217;t be looking at.  </p>
<p>I loathe this conflation of &#8216;aimed at over 18s&#8217; and &#8216;porn&#8217;, and these are difficult issues. But ok, I am an adult. If you go to GiffGaff&#8217;s &#8216;remove adult filter&#8217; in the UK you get the option to </p>
<p>A). Add two lines from your machine-readable passport (the ones with all the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;s in them) OR<br />
B). Add in your gender and drivers&#039; license number</p>
<p>I don&#039;t drive (and I don&#039;t see what my gender has to do with anything &#8211; anyway, can&#039;t you drive when you&#039;re 17?). So, passport then. The two lines include my: name, gender, date of birth, passport number, passport expiry date (and four checksums). </p>
<p>I really object to this. I&#039;m pretty careful with my data and I don&#039;t expect to have to give out a surfeit of personal information to a site just to look at a blogpost when I&#039;m on the move. I was getting angry about this on Twitter and someone (I forget who sorry) suggested that I could use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_passport">this algorithm</a> to generate the appropriate string. And it works: I made one change to my passport number to test it. The code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/libbymiller/6095798">here</a>. Make sure you get the length of the first string right &#8211; the error reporting is ambiguous. Given that it is a publicly available algorithm it maybe wasn&#8217;t the best way for them to get people to prove their age.</p>
<h4>Getting back Nike Fuelband data</h4>
<p>I love my <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband">fuelband</a> and have successfully gamified myself into doing much more moving about than I used to do because of it. The Fuelband is a robust, water-resistant accelerometer worn on your wrist. You set an activity goal in terms of Nike Fuel &#8216;points&#8217; (whatever they are), but it also tracks steps and has a nice watch and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicecupoftea/8672717307/">lots of colourful LEDs light up when you reach your goal</a>. </p>
<p>It is a USB device, and when you plug it in it phones home, firing up an app on your laptop and sending your data to the Nike cloud where you are supposed to compare progress with others and get badges for progress and other nonsense. Actually I find that I use it as a quick check of my activity levels throughout the day, and I don&#8217;t really look at my graphs, which in any case are not that interestingly implemented. I&#8217;ve been learning <a href="http://d3.js">d3.js</a> and I reckon I could make some nicer graphs, but there is no way to get an export of the data. Nike are planning a developer API but it is not available yet. Nevertheless, people have managed to get their data back, and I used <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPfBxBs5Zr0">this video</a> to get mine. The short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>you need the device id and an access token, which you can get using (for example) <a href="http://portswigger.net/burp/help/suite_gettingstarted.html">Burp</a>, by setting it as the https proxy &#8211; (I had to click &#8216;forward&#8217; to get it to work; I didn&#8217;t have to install the CA)</li>
<li>then you can make API calls like this:</li>
</ul>
<p><code><br />
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \<br />
-H "appid: fuelband" \<br />
-H "Accept: application/json" \<br />
"https://api.nike.com/v1.0/me/activities/summary/260713?deviceid=XXX&amp;access_token=XXX&amp;endDate=270713&amp;fidelity=96"</code></p>
<p>fin.</p>
<p>Extremely easy in fact.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer for it not to send the data to Nike at all, but that will have to wait. There is more detail about the API calls available in the video.</p>
<p>(As a side-note, I suspect that these activity devices are not about selling hardware; a friend got Fitbit to send her a new one after she lost it, which is great customer service but suggests their business model might lie elsewhere).</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/303/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/303/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=planb.nicecupoftea.org&#038;blog=7954761&#038;post=303&#038;subd=libbymiller&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some of the <a title="Radiodan" href="https://gist.github.com/libbymiller/e58d8da5f19d41861fd1">Radiodan</a> applications Richard, Anton and I discussed on thursday at the Bristol <a href="http://bristol.hackspace.org.uk">Hackspace</a>, we need a rotary encoder. For example, this &#8216;Wrong (W)radio: Time Travel Radio can play audio from the last few days, navigating time by turning the right hand knob:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/9158910612_cf0f5bf1ae_k.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-281" alt="Image" src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/9158910612_cf0f5bf1ae_k.jpg?w=487" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not done much work with the Raspi GPIO, but Richard found an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/blog/2013/01/18/rotary-encoder-library-for-the-raspberry-pi-piday-raspberrypi-raspberry_pi/">Adafruit example</a>, and then I found <a href="http://theatticlight.net/posts/Reading-a-Rotary-Encoder-from-a-Raspberry-Pi/">this one</a>, that looked simpler on the face of it &#8211; except that my C isn&#8217;t exactly great, and doesn&#8217;t in fact exist. Anyway it had a <a href="http://theatticlight.net/images/rotary_encoder_raspi.png">nice simple example</a> of how to wire a rotary encoder to the Raspi (plus an explanation of the other two legs on my rotary encoder &#8211; they&#8217;re for the built-in button).</p>
<p>After a bit of a struggle, I got it to work &#8211; the library needs <a href="https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/">wiringPi</a></p>
<pre>git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
git pull origin
cd wiringPi
git pull origin
./build</pre>
<p>then</p>
<pre>git cloneÂ <a href="https://github.com/astine/rotaryencoder/blob/master/rotaryencoder.c">https://github.com/astine/rotaryencoder

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some rough notes from our IRFS hardware hackday so I can find them again. The hackday was organised by <a href="http://cefn.com/blog/">Cefn Hoile</a>, <a href="http://andrewnicolaou.co.uk">Andrew Nicolaou</a> and <a href="http://www.jasminecox.co.uk">Jasmine Cox</a>, and was utterly brilliant.</p>
<p>This is work by Dan Nuttall, Jasmine Cox, Sean O&#8217;Halpin, Nikolaos Tsipas and me (though I did little!) at a hackday organised as part of our 10% time at IRFS at BBC R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The idea was to make a panic button for radio, that allowed you to skip all or part of a programme, e.g. the Archers.</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aa_plan.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aa_plan.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="aa_plan" width="225" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-251" /></a></p>
<p>here&#8217;s the version we made:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aa_green_box.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aa_green_box.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="aa_green_box" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-250" /></a></p>
<p>here&#8217;s the more exciting &#8216;farmer&#8217; interface, designed by Jasmine and hooked up by Nikolaos:</p>
<p><a href="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aa_farmer.jpg"><img src="http://libbymiller.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/aa_farmer.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="aa_farmer" width="300" height="225" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-249" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video of a wifi version I made at home: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicecupoftea/8649416824/in/photostream/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicecupoftea/8649416824/in/photostream/</a></p>
<p>It consists of a Raspberry PI, a home-made <a href="http://shrimping.it">Shrimp</a> with a button, some code that plays IP streams for the audio, which listens for changes to a file and switches streams when it sees a change. Code listens to the serial port and when it detects a button change, changes the right file. I guess we could use the GPIO on the Pi for the button, but I don&#8217;t know how to do that yet.</p>
<p>At home, I had a go with my own Pi &#8211; I had a power supply and wifi card for it, but no fancy display. This is what I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry pi</li>
<li>SD card (I used a speed 10 generic 8GB one)</li>
<li>some sort of speaker</li>
<li>wifi usb card for the pi</li>
<li>power supply for the pi</li>
<li>arduino or shrimp with a button</li>
</ul>
<p>I installed wheezy on an SD card via this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads</a><br />
<a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup</a></p>
<p>I then put it in the PI, connected via ethernet and sharing internet on the Mac. I got the IP address using</p>
<p>ping 192.168.2.255</p>
<p>and looking in console.app for a response from a pi &#8211; it was 192.168.2.4. I ssh&#8217;ed to that using pi@192.168.2.4 password raspberry, then tried to update apt-get<br />
<code><br />
sudo apt-get update<br />
Err <a href="http://archive.raspberrypi.org" rel="nofollow">http://archive.raspberrypi.org</a> wheezy InRelease</p>
<p>Err <a href="http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org" rel="nofollow">http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org</a> wheezy InRelease</p>
<p>Err <a href="http://archive.raspberrypi.org" rel="nofollow">http://archive.raspberrypi.org</a> wheezy Release.gpg<br />
  Temporary failure resolving 'archive.raspberrypi.org'</p>
<p></code></p>
<p>The default nameserver from the mac didn&#8217;t work. Using the google dns fixed it, though this kept getting overwritten on a reboot for some reason:</p>
<p>sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf<br />
<code><br />
nameserver 8.8.8.8<br />
nameserver 8.8.4.4<br />
</code></p>
<p>then update apt-get<br />
<code><br />
sudo apt-get update<br />
</code></p>
<p>Install mpd player<br />
<code><br />
sudo apt-get install mpd </p>
<p>[....] Starting Music Player Daemon: mpdlisten: bind to '[::1]:6600' failed: Failed to create socket: Address family not supported by protocol (continuing anyway, because binding to '127.0.0.1:6600' succeeded)<br />

. ok </p>
<p></code></p>
<p>Install the stuff needed for Dan&#8217;s player code:<br />
<code><br />
sudo aptitude install ruby1.9.1-dev #for bundler<br />
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev<br />
sudo apt-get install git #install git<br />
</code></p>
<p>Install Dan&#8217;s code:<br />
<code><br />
git clone <a href="https://github.com/pixelblend/radiodan.git" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pixelblend/radiodan.git</a> # the code<br />
sudo gem install bundler #to get all the required gems<br />
cd radiodan<br />
bundle install<br />
</code></p>
<p>Put the simple button code on the arduino using laptop:<br />
<code><br />
// set pin numbers:<br />
const int buttonPin = 2;     // the number of the pushbutton pin<br />
const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin</p>
<p>// variables will change:<br />
int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status</p>
<p>void setup() {<br />
&nbsp;// initialize the LED pin as an output:<br />
&nbsp;pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);<br />
&nbsp;// initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:<br />
&nbsp;pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);<br />
&nbsp;Serial.begin(9600);<br />
}</p>
<p>void loop(){<br />
&nbsp;// read the state of the pushbutton value:<br />
&nbsp;buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);<br />
&nbsp;//Serial.println(buttonState);<br />
&nbsp;// check if the pushbutton is pressed.<br />
&nbsp;// if it is, the buttonState is HIGH:<br />
&nbsp;if (buttonState == HIGH) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;// turn LED on:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Serial.println("on");<br />
&nbsp;}<br />
&nbsp;else {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;// turn LED off:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;//Serial.println("off");</p>
<p>&nbsp;}<br />
}<br />
</code></p>
<p>Install required gem for Sean&#8217;s serial reading code:<br />
<code><br />
sudo gem install serialport<br />
</code></p>
<p>add in Sean&#8217;s ruby code in radiodan/bin/read-serial.rb :<br />
<code><br />
require 'serialport'</p>
<p>filename = ARGV[0] or abort "Need to specify path to file"<br />

ensure<br />
&nbsp;sp.close<br />
end<br />
</code></p>
<p>plug in the arduino to the pi using the USB port, and identify it:<br />
<code><br />
ls /dev | grep USB<br />
&gt; ttyUSB0<br />
</code></p>
<p>run the serial code in the background<br />
<code><br />
cd bin<br />
ruby read-serial.rb /dev/ttyUSB0<br />
</code></p>
<p>and<br />
<code><br />
./bin/download # get the data - should run in the background<br />
./bin/radio<br />
</code></p>
<p>-&gt; at this point if it&#8217;s all running correctly it should work (hear R4 from speaker, press the button and it goes to radio 1 for 5 secs and then returns)</p>

<p>I did this at the end, which took a looong time:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to continue and update the software packages list, kernel software<br />
packages and upgrade the Pi&#8217;s firmware and software or do you want to terminate<br />
the script?&#8221;</p>
<p>get IP addresss with ifconfig and use wlan0<br />
<code><br />
iwconfig<br />
</code></p>
<p>-&gt; should be associated with an SSID</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7166/6785289453_e4aa22fef5.jpg" /> </p>
<p>which connects to the web in order to send commands. My first version was with a Nanode with built-in ethernet, but I also have a Arduino Duemilanove ATmega168, so I thought I&#8217;d try that with my new Wifly shield and a battery pack.</p>
<p>The Wifly shield is <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/wifly-shield-p-608.html">this version</a> and I have some <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/header-kit-for-arduino-board-p-428.html">stackable headers</a> to go with it. I connected the shield on top of the Arduino like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7198/7010448777_6c6b3cfa5c.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can see that the USB socket means that the shield is a bit high up.</p>
<p>I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/jmr13031/WiFly-Shield">this version of the Wifly library</a> that&#8217;s been recently changed to work with Arduino 1.0 Library. All connected up, and running this code from the examples:</p>
<p><code></p>
<p>#include "WiFly.h"</p>
<p>char passphrase[] = "pass";<br />
char ssid[] = "ssid";</p>
<p>byte server[] = { 66, 249, 89, 104 }; // Google</p>
<p>Client client("google.com", 80);</p>
<p>void setup() {</p>
<p>  Serial.begin(9600);<br />
  delay(100);<br />
  Serial.println("[Wifly]");</p>
<p>  WiFly.begin();</p>
<p>  Serial.println("finished beginning");</p>
<p>  if (!WiFly.join(ssid, passphrase)) {<br />
    Serial.println("Association failed.");<br />
    while (1) {<br />
      // Hang on failure.<br />
    }<br />
  }</p>
<p>  Serial.println("connecting...");</p>
<p>  if (client.connect()) {<br />
    Serial.println("connected");<br />
    client.println("GET /search?q=arduino HTTP/1.0");<br />
    client.println();<br />
  } else {<br />
    Serial.println("connection failed");<br />
  }</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>void loop() {<br />
  if (client.available()) {<br />
    char c = client.read();<br />
    Serial.print(c);<br />
  }</p>
<p>  if (!client.connected()) {<br />
    Serial.println();<br />
    Serial.println("disconnecting.");<br />
    client.stop();<br />
    for(;;)<br />
      ;<br />
  }<br />
}</p>
<p></code></p>
<p>it was hanging on Wifly.begin(). </p>
<p>After a bit of hunting round I found <a href="http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,58092.msg490340.html#msg490340">this detailed description of what might be up</a> &#8211; essentially a timeout, and then twice only, while I was fiddling with the headers, <a href="https://github.com/jmr13031/WiFly-Shield/blob/master/src/WiFly/examples/tools/SpiUartTerminal/SpiUartTerminal.pde">SpiUartTerminal.pde</a> worked.</p>
<p>The rest of the time it just hangs on this:</p>
<p><code><br />
Attempting to connect to SPI UART...<br />
</code></p>
<p>So really I&#8217;m looking for a bit of advice &#8211; I don&#8217;t really want to solder it on, but are there better ways of connecting the shield to the Arduino? Are headers typically less reliable than soldering? Is there a better way to connect the shield somehow maybe using a breadboard? (e.g. <a href="http://cairohackerspace.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/beginners-guide-to-connecting-and.html">like this</a>). Or am I just doing something daft &#8230;?</p>
<p>UPDATE: Thanks to John (see comment below) I sorted out the problem, which was a newby issue: stackable headers need to be soldered! Anyway I persuaded Damian to solder for me (I&#8217;ve never done it before) and we now have a working wireless, battery-powered remote control:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7212/6867484812_9cef8e6ff9.jpg" /></p>
<p>(All it does is send the category to a http web service and that randomly chooses an item from all iPlayer available items in that category, and sends it to a web page connected with XMPP).</p>
<p>Thanks everyone who helped. I&#8217;m very pleased with it <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-bigsmile' title=':D'>:D</span></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/223/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/223/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=planb.nicecupoftea.org&#038;blog=7954761&#038;post=223&#038;subd=libbymiller&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here are some notes on my adventures trying to make an ethernet connected Nanode that blinks when certain words are mentioned on twitter. I was working with Mac OS X and there were a few gotchas, so I&#8217;ve mentioned them here so I don&#8217;t forget and in case anything is useful to anyone else. There&#8217;s an exciting video of the resulting beast <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicecupoftea/6691338473/">here</a> featuring the <a href="http://www.skpang.co.uk/catalog/acrylic-case-for-nanode-p-974.html">acrylic case from the excellent and fast SKPang</a>. The code (an unholy mixture of C++ and Processing) is <a href="https://github.com/libbymiller/Arduino/tree/master/ethernet_client">here</a>. I was coming at this as someone who&#8217;d previously only got blinking and similar going on a Arduino Duemilanove.</p>
<h4>Getting the Nanode working</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Buy a <a href="http://nanode.eu/">Nanode</a> (<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield">ethernet Arduinos</a> are also available, I chose a Nanode because it was recommended to me, also their support is very good and it arrived very quickly. I think in retrospect it&#8217;s a bit hard to use for a real novice like me, though I enjoyed finding out&#8230;). I got a prebuilt Nanode RFX (which has a Hope RF shield and a microSD slot). You need to also buy a Programming Adaptor, which you need in order to talk to a Nanode as the USB programming interface isn&#8217;t built in.
        </li>
<li>
Download the <a href="http://arduino.cc/hu/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a>
        </li>
<li>
Install the <a href="http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx">FTDI driver</a> (see <a href="http://sustburbia.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-nanode-programming-lead.html?showComment=1324496343052#c6066041842684048441">this comment, which helped me out a lot</a>) &#8211; installing it will restart your computer. This is a different driver to the one you use with a standard Arduino &#8211; see <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Howto">the Arduino guide if you&#8217;re not using a Nanode</a>
        </li>
<li>
Open the blink Arduino example (under file -&gt; examples -&gt; Basic, or <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/blink">here</a>) and change the output to 6
        </li>
<li>
Connect the Nanode to the Mac using the FTDI cable using a USB cable
        </li>
<li>
In the IDE, set the port to the newÂ driver and the board to &#8216;Arduino Duemilanove with ATMega 328&#8242;
        </li>
<li>
Compile and run the Blink example on the Nanode
        </li>
<li>
The default LED on the Nanode should blink
        </li>
<li>
Celebrate
        </li>
</ul>
<h4>Connecting up Ethernet</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Install Ethernet Library -&gt; cd ~/Documents/Arduino; mkdir libraries
        </li>
<li>
Download <a href="http://jeelabs.net/projects/11/wiki/EtherCard">EtherCard</a> library and unzip it in this directory
        </li>
<li>
Restart the Arduino IDE and you should see sketch / import library &#8211; a new library (not Ethernet but EtherCard at the bottom)
        </li>
<li>
Start a new sketch
        </li>
<li>
Next I copied and pasted <a href="http://jeelabs.net/projects/cafe/repository/show/EtherCard/examples/webClient">this WebClient example from EtherCard</a> into a new file, and that formed the basis of my code.
        </li>
<li>
Click on sketch / import library &#8211; and import EtherCard &#8211; and it puts some import statements at the top
        </li>
<li>
Add this at the top: #include <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>
        </li>
<li>
Connect it to an ethernet connection (e.g. I shared airport to ethernet connection on my mac)
        </li>
</ul>
<p>The one problem I had was that it appeared to work intermittently, or once per restart of the board. I think this must have been some sort of race condition. Anyway, I solved it by adding a tiny wait after these two lines:<br />
<code><br />
void loop () {</p>
<p>Â ether.packetLoop(ether.packetReceive());</p>
<p>Â delay(100); //&lt;-- Â add this.</p>
<p>...<br />
</code></p>
<p>If you look then at the serial monitor (button with the little magnifing glass on the top right of the Arduino IDE), you should see some results. Click restart on the Nanode if not. It takes a while to get the IP address.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Danbri and I invested a few hours in a rapid node.js prototype for NoTube. We&#8217;ll blog about it properly elsewhere, but this is just a little note about a bit of curious behaviour we found, in case anyone runs into the same problem.</p>
<p>Just before christmas Dan made a node.js xmpp bot that could appear in <a href="http://notube.tv/2011/10/10/n-screen-a-second-screen-application-for-small-group-exploration-of-on-demand-content/">N-Screen</a> and take commands via drag and drop (if you don&#8217;t care about this, the point is that it uses <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> with <a href="https://github.com/astro/node-xmpp">node-xmpp</a>). Dan got it showing up in the N-Screen interface and reflecting back whatever you dropped on it. I thought it would be trivial to hook in one of the item-to-item recommenders I have working via a json http api. Basically to do http GETs in node.js you need something like this:<br />
<code><br />
var http = require('http');</p>
<p>var data_client = http.createClient(80, "nscreen.notu.be");<br />
var request = data_client.request('GET', '/iplayer_dev/api/suggest?pid='+pid',  {'host': 'nscreen.notu.be'});<br />
request.end();</p>
<p>request.on('response', function (response) {<br />
  response.setEncoding('utf8');<br />
  var myStr = "";<br />
  response.on('data', function (chunk) {<br />
    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);<br />
    myStr += chunk;<br />
  });<br />
  response.on('end', function (response) {<br />
    console.log(myStr);<br />
  }<br />
});<br />
</code></p>
<p>Then you can parse myStr e.g.<br />
<code><br />
var j = JSON.parse(myStr);<br />
</code></p>
<p>What we wanted to do was send that myStr as a string content of an xmpp message like this:<br />
<code><br />
var cl = new xmpp.Client({<br />
  jid: jid + '/bot',<br />
  password: password<br />
});</p>
<p>cl.on('stanza', function(stanza) {<br />
  var msg = { to: stanza.attrs.from , type: 'chat' };</p>
<p> ... get myStr of recommendations based on that message</p>
<p>  cl.send(new xmpp.Element('message', msg ).c('body').t(myStr) );<br />
});<br />
</code></p>
<p>It really should have been simple, but in practice the myStr existed when printed out to console but was never sent. At first we thought it was something to do with Buffers &#8211; if you don&#8217;t do response.setEncoding(&#8230;) you get Buffers back and perhaps some stringification of those wasn&#8217;t working, but no. To add to the confusion we could create Json objects from the string but they still would not send, even if copied to new strings. </p>
<p>In retrospect it&#8217;s obvious it was the XMPP that was the issue, but it took line by line trial and error sending of some sample input before I found it: &amp; characters in the input were causing silent failure when the message was sent &#8211; presumably due to an XML parsing problem that for some reason didn&#8217;t show up as an error (I know almost nothing about node.js so there could have been some user error there too). Escaping these &amp; didn&#8217;t seem to work, so for now we&#8217;ve just removed them and it all works fine. We need to raise a bug report, but thought I&#8217;d blog for now in case it helps anyone else.

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NoTube uses a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">Mediawiki</a> installation kindly provided by <a href="http://www.sti2.org/">sti2.org</a> for its internal documentation. As the project draws to a close (we finish officially on January 31st 2012, with our final review in late March) we wanted to make sure we had a copy of everything we had done over the last few years. Much of this is and will remain private to the partners but there are some interesting ideas and usecases we wrote down early on that we don&#8217;t want to lose track of. I hadn&#8217;t realised that by default <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page">Mediawiki has an API</a>, but once I did, it was pretty simple to download all the pages. I&#8217;ve put the Ruby script <a href="https://github.com/notube/Code_snippets/tree/master/download_mediawiki">on github</a> in case it&#8217;s useful to anyone else. Basically the only fiddly bit is the cookies. You do, of course, need a username and password for the wiki you want to download, but thereafter, there&#8217;s an API call you can call recursively to get a list of all pages, and then download them individually. </p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/191/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/libbymiller.wordpress.com/191/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=planb.nicecupoftea.org&#038;blog=7954761&#038;post=191&#038;subd=libbymiller&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In September I participated in the programme committee of the W3C&#8217;s <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/09/web-on-tv/">Web On TV</a> workshop, which was held in Japan. Because of some existing committments I was not able to go to the face-to-face meeting, so to try and make up for it, I read through all the papers instead of just my allocated ones. My  notes are below. These are just my personal opinions, and I&#8217;m not an expert in the TV field (although Web and TV <em>is</em> my thing &#8211; I work on the <a href="http://blog.notube.tv">NoTube project</a>).  All the papers are <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/09/web-on-tv/papers/">public</a>. There is also a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/09/webTVIGcharter.html">Draft Web and TV Interest Group Charter</a>. The title of this post is stolen from <a href="http://danbri.org">danbri</a> who was pointing out that Web AND TV need not be Web ON TV. </p>
<p>These reviews are very short &#8211; most of the papers are themselves very short, being expressions of interest. In some cases I just use a representative quote from the paper. The attempt here is to summarise not to evaluate them, though I indicate where I am interested in a particular topic. The workshop summary is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/09/web-on-tv/summary.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A large group were interested in BML and explaining why it&#8217;s important, perhaps indicating that they do not see a reason to change from using that.</p>
<p>A group are interested in HTML5 and how it might work with BML for interactive applications, and a subgroup interested in user interfaces for TV and common UIs for TV and other devices using HTML5.</p>
<p>There is an overlapping group who see the TV as being a hub for home entertainment, which seems to mean that everything is controlled via the TV, web pages are viewed on the TV etc.</p>
<p>There is also a group interested in APIs for TV and other devices (such as controls).</p>
<p>There is a strong sense that IPTV is very important and standards for it are important, especially DRM and efficiency.</p>
<p>I get the impression that there are a lot of participants who have specific scenarios in mind and also a number who are looking for interesting aplications of HTML5 to TV.</p>
<p>Papers 21 and 27, 30 are the most interesting from my point of view. 31 makes an important point. I&#8217;ve a lot of sympathy with 36. 39 and 41 are also interesting.</p>
