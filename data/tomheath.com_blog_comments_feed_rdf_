	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Ian Davis" href="http://iandavis.com/id/me">Ian</a> recently published a <a title="Ian's original post" href="http://iand.posterous.com/is-303-really-necessary">blog post</a> that he&#8217;d finally got around to writing, several months after a fierce internal debate at Talis about whether the Web of Data needs HTTP 303 redirects. I can top that. Ian&#8217;s post unleashed a flood of anti-303 sentiment that has prompted me to finish a blog post I started in February 2008.</p>
<p>Picture the scene: six geeks sit around a table in the bar of a Holiday Inn, somewhere in West London. It&#8217;s late, we&#8217;re drunk, and debating 303 redirects and the distinction between information and non-information resources. Three <a title="Keith Alexander" href="http://keithalexander.co.uk/">of</a> <a title="Libby Miller" href="http://nicecupoftea.org/">the</a> <a title="Benjamin Nowack" href="http://bnode.org/about">geeks</a> exit stage left, leaving me to thrash it out with <a title="Dan Brickley" href="http://danbri.org/">Dan</a> and <a title="Damian Steer" href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/aboutus/staff/staffprofile/?search=cmdms">Damian</a>. Some time shortly afterwards Dan calls me a &#8220;303 fascist&#8221;, presumably for advocating the use of HTTP 303 redirects when serving Linked Data, as per the <a title="httpRange-14" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html#httpRange-14">W3C TAG&#8217;s finding on httpRange-14</a>.</p>
<p>I never got to the bottom of Dan&#8217;s objection &#8211; technical? philosophical? historical? -ÃÂ  but there is seemingly no end to the hand-wringing that we as a community seem willing to engage in about this issue.</p>
<p>Ian&#8217;s post lists nine objections to the 303 redirect pattern, most of which don&#8217;t stand up to closer scrutiny. Let&#8217;s take them one at a time:</p>
<p><strong>1. it requires an extra round-trip to the server for every request</strong></p>
<p>For whom is this an issue? Users? Data publishers? Both?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the former then the argument doesn&#8217;t wash. Consider a typical request for a Web page. The browser requests the page, the server sends the HTML document in response. (Wait, should that be &#8220;<em>an HTML representation of the resource denoted by the URI</em>&#8220;, or whatever? If we want to get picky about the terminology of Web architecture then lets start with the resource/representation minefield. I would bet hard cash that the typical Web user or developer is better able to understand the distinction between information resources and non-information resources than between resources and representations of resources).</p>
<p>Anyway, back to our typical request for a Web page&#8230; The browser parses the HTML document, finds references to images and stylesheets hosted on the same server, and quite likely some JavaScript hosted elsewhere. Each of the former requires another request to the original server, while the latter triggers requests to other domains. In the worst case scenario these other domains aren&#8217;t in the client&#8217;s (or their ISP&#8217;s) DNS cache, thereby requiring a DNS lookup on the hostname and increasing the overall time cost of the request.</p>
<p>In this context, is a 303 redirect and the resulting round-trip really an issue for users of the HTML interfaces to Linked Data applications? I doubt it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s an issue for data publishers. Perhaps those serving (or planning to serve) Linked Data are worried about whether their Web servers can handle the extra requests/second that 303s entail. If that&#8217;s the case, presumably the same data publishers insist that their development teams chuck all their CSS into a single stylesheet, in order to prevent any unnecessary requests stemming from using multiple stylesheets per HTML document. I doubt it.</p>
<p>My take home message is this: in the grand scheme of things, the extra round-trip stemming from a 303 redirect is of very little significance to users or data publishers. Eyal Oren raised the very valid question some time ago of <a title="Are 303s Cacheable?" href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2007Jul/0078.html">whether 303s should be cached</a>. Redefining this in the HTTP spec seems eminently sensible. So why hasn&#8217;t it happened? If just a fraction of the time spent debating 303s and IR vs. NIR was spent lobbying to get that change made then we would have some progress to report. Instead we just have hand-wringing and FUD for potential Linked Data adopters.</p>
<p><strong>2. only one description can be linked from the toucan&#8217;s URI</strong></p>
<p>Do people actually want to link to more than one description of a resource? Perhaps there are multiple documents on a site that describe the same thing, and it would be useful to point to them both. (Wait, we have a mechanism for that! It&#8217;s called a hypertext/hyperdata link). But maybe someone has two static files on the same server that are both equally valid descriptions of the same resource. Yes, in that case it would be useful to be able to point to both; so just create an RDF document that sits behind a 303 redirect and contains some <em>rdfs:seeAlso</em> statements to the more extensive description, or serve up your data from an RDF store that can pull out all statements describing the resource, and return them as one document.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy the idea that people actually want to point to multiple descriptions apart from in the data itself. If there are other equivalent resources out there on the Web then state their equivalence, don&#8217;t just link to their descriptions. There may be 10 or 100 or 1000 equivalent resources referenced in an RDF document. 303 redirects make it very clear which is the authoritative description of a specific resource.</p>
<p><strong>3. the user enters one URI into their browser and ends up at a different one, causing confusion when they want to reuse the URI of the toucan. Often they use the document URI by mistake.</strong></p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s break this issue down into two distinct scenarios. Job Public who wants to bookmark something, and Joe Developer who wants to hand-craft some RDF (using the correct URI to identify the toucan).</p>
<p>Again, I would bet hard cash that Joe Public doesn&#8217;t want to reuse the URI of the toucan in his bookmarks, emails, tweets etc. I would bet that he wants to reuse the URI of <em>the document describing the toucan</em>. No one sends emails saying &#8220;<em>hey, read this toucan</em>&#8220;. People say &#8220;<em>hey, read this document about a toucan</em>&#8220;. In this case it doesn&#8217;t matter one bit that the document URI is being used.</p>
<p>Things can get a bit more complicated in the Joe Developer scenario, and the awful URI pattern used in DBpedia, where it&#8217;s visually hard to notice the change from <em>/resource</em> to <em>/data</em> or <em>/page</em>, doesn&#8217;t help at all. So change it. Or agree to never use that pattern again. If documents describing things in DBpedia ended <em>.rdf</em> or <em>.html</em> would we even be having this debate?</p>
<p>Joe Developer also has to take a bit of responsibility for writing sensible RDF statements. Unfortunately, people like <a title="Ed Summers" href="http://inkdroid.org/">Ed</a> <a href="http://inkdroid.org/journal/2010/11/08/routers-webcams-and-thermometers/">seeming to conflate himself and his homepage (and his router and its admin console)</a> don&#8217;t help with the general level of understanding. I&#8217;ve tried many times to explain to someone that I am not my homepage, and as far as I know I&#8217;ve never failed. In all this frantic debate about the 303 <em>mechanism</em>, let&#8217;s not abandon certain basic principles that just make sense.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Ian was suggesting in his posts that he is his homepage, so let&#8217;s be very, very explicit about what we&#8217;re debating here &#8212; 303 redirects &#8212; and not muddy the waters by bringing other topics into the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>4. its non-trivial to configure a web server to issue the correct redirect and only to do so for the things that are not information resources.</strong></p>
<p>Ian claims this is non-trivial. Nor is running a Drupal installation. I know, it powers <a title="Linked Data" href="http://linkeddata.org/">linkeddata.org</a>, and maintaining it is a PITA. That doesn&#8217;t stop thousands of people doing it. Let&#8217;s be honest, very little in Web technology is trivial. Running a Web server in your basement isn&#8217;t trivial &#8211; that&#8217;s why people created wordpress.com, Flickr, MySpace, etc., bringing Web publishing to the masses, and why most of us would rather pay Web hosting companies to do the hard stuff for us. If people really see this configuration issue as a barrier then they should get on with implementing a server that makes it trivial, or teach people how to make the necessary configuration changes.</p>
<p><strong>5. the server operator has to decide which resources are information resources and which are not without any precise guidance on how to distinguish the two (the official definition speaks of things whose &#8220;essential characteristics can be conveyed in a message&#8221;). I enumerate some examples here but it&#8217;s easy to get to the absurd.</strong></p>
<p>The original guidance from the TAG stated that a 200 indicated an information resource, whereas a 303 could indicate any type of resource. If in doubt, use a 303 and redirect to a description of the resource. Simple.</p>
<p><strong>6. it cannot be implemented using a static web server setup, i.e. one that serves static RDF documents</strong></p>
<p>In this case hash URIs are more suitable anyway. This has always been the case.</p>
<p><strong>7. it mixes layers of responsibility &#8211; there is information a user cannot know without making a network request and inspecting the metadata about the response to that request. When the web server ceases to exist then that information is lost.</strong></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t this be resolved by adding additional triples to the document that describes the resource, stating the relationship between a resource and its description?</p>
<p><strong>8. the 303 response can really only be used with things that aren&#8217;t information resources. You can&#8217;t serve up an information resource (such as a spreadsheet) and 303 redirect to metadata about the spreadsheet at the same time.</strong></p>
<p>Metadata about an RDF document can be included in the document itself. Perhaps a more Web-friendly alternative to Excel could allow for richer embeddable metadata.</p>
<p><strong>9. having to explain the reasoning behind using 303 redirects to mainstream web developers simply reinforces the perception that the semantic web is baroque and irrelevant to their needs.</strong></p>
<p>I fail to see how Ian&#8217;s proposal, when taken as a whole package, is any less confusing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~~</p>
<p>Having written this post I&#8217;m wondering whether the time would have been better spent on something more productive, which is precisely how I feel about the topic in general. As geeks I think we love obsessing about getting things &#8220;right&#8221;, but at what cost? Ian&#8217;s main objection seems to be about the barriers we put in the way of Linked Data adoption. From my own experience there is no better barrier than uncertainty. Arguments about HTTP 303s are far more harmful than 303s themselves. Let&#8217;s put the niggles aside and get on with making Linked Data the great success we all want it to be.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post was prompted by <a title="tweet from Tim O'Reilly" href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1266750154">this tweet from Tim O&#8217;Reilly</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>People learning about <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a> frequently ask &#8220;what&#8217;s the relationship between Linked Data and the <a title="Semantic Web" href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a>?&#8221;, which is a fair and good question. One of the responses that crops up relatively frequently is that Linked Data is just an attempt to rebrand the Semantic Web. In my experience these kind of rebranding comments come mostly  from people who have a certain impression of the Semantic Web vision (which may or may not be accurate), don&#8217;t like this vision, and therefore dismiss Linked Data on this basis without actually considering what it means (i.e. a means to dismantle data silos), and without necessarily rethinking their original view of the Semantic Web concept. I prefer to see it this way&#8230;</p>
<p>Think about HTML documents; when people started weaving these together with hyperlinks we got a Web of documents. Now think about data. When people started weaving individual bits of data together with RDF triples (that expressed the relationship between these bits of data) we saw the emergence of a Web of data. Linked Data is no more complex than this &#8211; connecting related data across the Web using URIs, HTTP and RDF. Of course there are many ways to have <em>linked data</em>, but in common usage <em>Linked Data</em> refers to the <a title="Linked Data principles" href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">principles</a> set out by Tim Berners-Lee in 2006.</p>
<p>So if we link data together using Web technologies, and according to these principles, the result is a Web of data. Personally I use the term <em>Web of data</em> largely interchangeably with the term <em>Semantic Web</em>, although not everyone in the Semantic Web world would agree with this. The precise term I use depends on the audience. With Semantic Web geeks I say Semantic Web, with others I tend to say Web of data &#8211; it&#8217;s not about rebranding, it&#8217;s about using terms that make sense to your audience, and <em>Web of data</em> speaks to people much more clearly than <em>Semantic Web</em>. Similarly, <em>Linked Data</em> isn&#8217;t about rebranding the Semantic Web, it&#8217;s about clarifying its fundamentals.</p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee said several times last year, in public, that &#8220;Linked Data is the Semantic Web done right&#8221; (e.g. see <a title="TimBL Slides" href="http://www.w3.org/2008/Talks/0617-lod-tbl/#(3)">these slides</a> from Linked Data Planet in New York), and who am I to argue, it&#8217;s his vision. But to see this as a recent trend or a u-turn ignores the historical context. On page 191 of my copy of Weaving the Web (dated 2000, ISBN-13: 9781587990182) it says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first step is putting data on the Web in a form that machines can naturally understand, or converting it to that form. This creates what I call a Semantic Web &#8211; a web of data that can be processed directly or indirectly by machines.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure this quote adequately captures the importance of links in the whole picture, but no one can claim that the Web of data label is recent marketing spin invented to make the Semantic Web palatable. This was always the deal. It&#8217;s certainly how I understood the concept (and what inspired me to do a PhD in the area).</p>
<p>If othersÃÂ  have somehow diverted the Semantic Web vision down some side road since Weaving the Web was written, then that&#8217;s unfortunate. (In my experience the Linking Open Data project was an attempt to reconnect the Semantic Web community with the some of the key aspects of the original vision that were being overlooked, like having a <em>real</em> Web of data as the basis for research). I certainly notice plenty of unjustified attempts at present to co-opt the term <em>Semantic Web</em>, now that it&#8217;s no longer a dirty word, and drive it off down some dodgy alleyway. Some of these products, services or companies may be applications or services that use some semantic technology and are delivered over the Web, but that doesn&#8217;t make them Semantic Web applications, services or companies. Anything claiming the Semantic Web label needs to get its hands dirty with Linked Data somewhere along the way. That&#8217;s just how it is.</p>
<p>So to return to Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s tweet, he&#8217;s not far wrong about the lack of difference between Linked Data, Semantic Web and RDF (we&#8217;ll ignore the means vs end vs technology distinction), but I&#8217;d love to know who he&#8217;s quoting about the explicit rebranding.</p>
