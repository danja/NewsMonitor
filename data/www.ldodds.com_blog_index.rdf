	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation">Many Worlds hypothesis</a> is true then we are living in a multiverse of parallel realities and alternate histories. Everything that could have happened did happen. At least somewhere. There are different views of how these parallel universes might differ from one another, formingÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">complete taxonomies of universe types</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to considerÂ <a href="http://www.askamathematician.com/2012/08/q-is-there-an-experiment-which-could-provide-conclusive-evidence-for-either-the-many-worlds-or-copenhagen-interpretations-of-quantum-physics/">what kind of experiments could be conducted</a> in order to prove that these realities exist. But it overlooks the fact that we interact with parallel realities all the time. Worlds that obey different physical and logical laws. Worlds that have their own unique landscapes. And worlds that share a geography but act out alternate histories. Worlds that many of us visit on at least a daily basis through readily available portals.</p>
<p>At the time I&#8217;m writing this blog post there are currently over 500,000 people playing <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/">DOTA 2</a>. That&#8217;s more than the population of Manchester. The number of people currently playing the survival gamesÂ <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/">Rust</a> and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/221100/">DayZ</a>Â is roughly the population of Bath. There are liveÂ <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/stats/">stats available from Steam</a>. The peak concurrent users for Steam today was 7.2m people. The fact that games are popular is not news to anyone, but that&#8217;s a lot of people visiting a variety of virtual realities. And its fun to think about them as more concrete spaces and consider the different ways in which we access them.</p>
<p>What follows is some follow-my-nose research on different types of game worlds, largely biased towards games that I&#8217;ve played or are familiar with in some way.</p>
<h2><span style="line-height:1.5em;">TheÂ Lifetime of Pocket Universes</span></h2>
<p>What should we consider to be a separate game universe?</p>
<p>A game server, which might be multi-player or single player, is a portal for accessing at least one virtual environment. Some game servers host a single persistent game world &#8212; or pocket universe &#8212; that will stick around for the lifetime of the server (barring system admin interventions). Other game servers will provide access to many, short-lived game worlds. Some may persist for only a few minutes, others for longer.</p>
<p>For example most first person shooters cycle through game worlds that last for around 10-15 minutes. But some offer a more consistentÂ environment: all DayZ Standalone servers hostÂ the exact same map (<a href="http://dayz.gamepedia.com/Chernarus%2B">Chernarus</a>) but the game clock and state varies between servers. Its possible to jump betweenÂ servers and appear in the exact same location but at different times.</p>
<p>This is something that has been limited in recent updates to DayZ because players were travelling withinÂ the Chernarus multiverse to get unfair advantages on other players. E.g. looting the same location across different servers, or getting the upper hand in a fight by flanking someone by jumping between servers. It&#8217;s beenÂ restricted by placing increasingly longer wait times for people hopping between servers. Although I found it to be an interesting game mechanic and I&#8217;d loveÂ to play a game in which it was a central motif.</p>
<p>While at any one time there may be multiple servers hosting a copy of the same game world, there are often differences. Time zonesÂ are one, but enemies and loot may alsoÂ spawn randomly, meaning that while the physical layout of the worlds are the same, their histories are different. Player actions are obviously significant and some game worlds offer more opportunities for permanently affecting the environment, e.g. by building or destroying objects.</p>
<p>At the extreme end of the scale are gameÂ worlds that are based entirely on<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation"> procedural generation</a>: no two pocket universes will be exactly the same, but they will obey the same physical laws.</p>
<h2>Number of Pocket Universes</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to get decent stats on the number of game servers and their distribution, some of the details are likely to be commercially sensitive. This is one area where I&#8217;d like to see more open data. Its not world changing, but its interesting to a lot of people.</p>
<p>The best resource I could find, apart from the high level Steam Statistics, was <a href="http://www.gametracker.com/">Game Tracker</a>. ThisÂ is a service that monitors game servers running across the net. Registered users can add servers to share them with friends and team mates. Currently there are over 130,000 different game servers being tracked by their system, spanning 91 different games. This will be a grossÂ under-estimate for the size of the gaming multiverse, but is a usefulÂ data point.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some interesting analysis that could be done on the distribution of those servers, across both games and countries, but unfortunately the terms of use for GameTracker do not allow harvesting of their data. Being able to locate game servers in the real world tells us where those universes intersect with ours.</p>
<p>Of course there are also some games in which there is only a single universe, although its state and geography is split across multiple game servers. Most MMORPGs operate on this basis, with <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a> probably being one of the more interesting. If only because it has<a href="http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/04/22/eves-anti-lag-time-dilation-concept-explained/"> a time dilation mechanic</a> that kicks in when lots of players are co-located on a single server: the passage of time slows down in a local area to allow all necessary computation to take place. The Eve game world actually spans more than one game. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_514">Dust 514</a> FPS exists in the same universe and there are ways to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_514#Connection_to_Eve_Online">interact between the games</a>.</p>
<p>MMORPGs also use &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_dungeon">instancing</a>&#8221; to spawn off smaller (fractal?!) pocket universes to allow groups of players to simultaneously access the same content in a sand boxed environment.Â This blending of public multi-player and private single-player spaces within game worlds is part of what is known as &#8220;<a href="http://www.edge-online.com/features/massive-attack-the-rise-of-mingleplayer/">mingleplayer</a>&#8221; (which is an awful term!)</p>
<p>Demon Souls and Dark Souls (both 1 &amp; 2) offer another interesting variation and, in my opinion, one of the earliest implementations of mingleplayer. In Dark Souls every player exists in their own copy of the game world, but those worlds are loosely connected to those of all other players. In Dark Souls 1 (and, I think Demon&#8217;s Souls) this was via a peer-to-peer network, but in Dark Souls 2 it&#8217;s a classic client-server set-up.Â In all of these games it&#8217;s possible to invade or be invited into other worlds to help or hinder them. There are also a number of mechanics to allow players to communicate in a limited and in some cases <a href="http://darksouls.wikidot.com/online#toc2">automatic</a> way between worlds. Typical of the series, there are also some unique and opaque systems that allow <a href="http://darksouls.wikidot.com/vagrant">items, creatures</a> and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/world-tendency">player actions</a> to spread between worlds.</p>
<h2>Game World Sizes</h2>
<p>So how big are these pocket universes? How to they compare to one another and with our own universe? There&#8217;s a few interesting facts and comparisons whichÂ I&#8217;ve dug up:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Minecraft world has <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Overworld#Sizes">a maximum limit of 4.7 quadrillionÂ km<sup>2</sup></a>Â  which is 9.3 million times the surface area of Earth. Which is large enough to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/01/a-journey-to-the-end-of-the-world-of-minecraft.html">explore for some time</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://playstarbound.com/">Starbound</a> universe <a href="http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/a-little-perspective-on-the-size-of-starbound.27178/#post-1063769">will have space for 422.22 quadrillion planets</a>.</li>
<li>No Man&#8217;s Sky sounds like it <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/445278/no-mans-sky-promises-enormous-discoverable-universe/">will be very large</a> too.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of people have also collected together game maps that show the relative sizes of different game environments:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1w7615/the_size_of_chernarus_dayz_compared_to_the/">Chernarus compared with typical Battlefield and Call of Duty maps</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1bvbyc/my_favorite_map_size_comparison_for_skyrim_and/">comparison of Skyrim and other game worlds in the series</a></li>
<li>A variety of different map size comparisons from <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/profile/aperturesilence/blog/a-relative-size-comparison-of-game-world-maps-fasc/49712/">Giant Bomb</a> and <a href="http://kotaku.com/this-years-biggest-video-game-is-not-call-of-duty-or-1211560224">Kotaku</a>Â both of which include some scaling information</li>
</ul>
<h2>In GameÂ Statistics</h2>
<p>Game publishers collect statistics on howÂ players move through their worlds. Sometimes this is just done during testing and level design in order to balance a map, in others the data is made available to players in real-time to help them improve their game, etc. There was an interesting article on <a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/15-09/ff_halo?currentPage=al">statistics collection in the Halo games</a>Â in Wired a few years ago. These kinds of statistics collection tools are a <a href="http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/GameStatsVisualizerReference.html">fundamental part of many design tools</a> these days.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been some interesting visualisation work around these statistics too. I wonder whether any of this could be applied to real-world data? For example <a href="http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2011/06/01/balance-and-flow-maps-2/">balance and flow maps</a> provide different perspectives on events. And here is <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/uk/2011/05/27/just-cause-2-video-maps-every-in-game-death-in-one-haunting-landscape/">a visualisation of every player death in Just Cause 2</a>.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/933/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/933/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=933&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading a document this week that referred to an &#8220;Open API&#8221;. It occurred to me that I hadn&#8217;tÂ really thought about what that term was supposed to mean before. Having looked at the API in question, it turned out it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk">did not mean what I thought it meant</a>. The definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_API">Open API</a> on Wikipedia and the associated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_APIs">list of Open APIs</a> are also both a bit lacklustre.</p>
<p>We could probably do with being more precise about what we mean by that term, particularly in how it relates to Open Source and Open Data. So far I&#8217;ve seen it used in several different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>An API that is <strong>free for anyone to use</strong> &#8212; I think it would be clearer to refer to these as &#8220;Public APIs&#8221;. Some may require authentication, some may only have a limited free tier of usage, but the API is accessible to anyone that wants to use it</li>
<li>An API that is <strong>backed by open data</strong> &#8212; the data that is extracted by the API is covered by <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">an open licence</a>. A Public API isn&#8217;t necessarily backed by Open Data. While it might be free for me to use anÂ API, I may be limited in how I can use the data by APIÂ terms and/or a non-open data licence that applies to the data</li>
<li>An API that is <strong>based on an open standard</strong> &#8212; the data available viaÂ an API might not be open, but the means of accessing and querying the data is covered by a specification that has been created by a standards body or has otherwise be openly published, e.g. the specification of the API is covered by an open licence. The important thing here is that the API could be (re-)implemented in an open source or commercial product without infringing on anyone&#8217;s rights or intellectual property. The specification of APIs that serve open data aren&#8217;t necessarily open. A commercial vendor may provide a data publishing service whose API is entirely proprietary.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally I think an Open API is one that meets that final definition.</p>
<p>These are important distinctions and I&#8217;d encourage you to look at the APIs you&#8217;re using or the API&#8217;sÂ you&#8217;re publishing and considering into which category they fall. APIs built on open source software typically fall into the third category: aÂ reference implementation and API documentation are already in the open. It&#8217;s easy to create alternate versions, improve an existing code base, or run a copy of a service.</p>
<p>While the data in a platform may be open, lock-in (whether planned or otherwise) can happen whenÂ APIs are proprietary. This limits competition and the ability for both data publishers and consumers to choose other vendors. This is also one reason why APIs shouldn&#8217;t be the default for open government data: at some level the raw data should be portable and useful outside of whatever platform the organisation may choose to deploy. Ideally platforms aimed at supporting open government data publishing should be open source orÂ should, at the very least, openly licence their API documentation.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/938/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/938/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=938&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be successful the web sacrificed some of the features of hypertext systems. Things like backwards linking and link integrity, etc. One of the great things about the web is that its possible to rebuild some of those features, but in a distributed way. Different communities can then address their own requirements.</p>
<p>Link integrity is one of those aspects. In many cases link integrity is not an issue. Some web resources are ephemeral (e.g. pastebin snippets), but others &#8212; particularly those used and consumed by scholarly communities &#8212; need to be longer lived. CrossRef and other members of the DOI Foundation have been successfully building linking services that attempt to provide persistent links to material references in scholarly research, for many years.</p>
<p>Yesterday Geoff Bilder published <a href="http://crosstech.crossref.org/2013/09/dois-unambiguously-and-persistently-identify-published-trustworthy-citable-online-scholarly-literature-right.html">a great piece that describes what CrossRef and others are doing in this area</a>, highlighting the different communities being served and the different features that the services offer. Just because something has a DOI doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it reliable, give any guarantees about its quality, or even imply what kind of resource it is; but it may have some guarantees around persistence.</p>
<p>Geoff&#8217;s piece highlights some similar concerns that I&#8217;ve had recently. I&#8217;m particularly concerned that there seems to be some notion that for something to be citeable it must have a DOI. That&#8217;s not true. For something to be citeable it just needs to be online, so people can point at it.</p>
<p>There may be other qualities we want the resource to have, e.g. persistence, but if your goal is to share some data, then get it online first, then address the persistence issue.Â Data and content sharing platforms and services can help there but we need to assess them against different criteria, e..g whether they are good publishing platforms, and separately whether they can make good claims about persistence and longevity.</p>
<p>Assessing persistence means more than just assessing technical issues, it means understanding the legal and business context of the service. What are its terms of service? Does the service have any kind of long term business plan that means it can make viable claims about longevity of the links it produces, etc.</p>
<p>I recently came across a service called <a href="http://www.perma.cc/">perma.cc</a>Â that aims to bring some stability to legal citations. There&#8217;s a New York Times article that <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/politics/in-supreme-court-opinions-clicks-that-lead-nowhere.html">highlights some of the issues</a> and the goals of the service.</p>
<p>The perma.cc service allows users to create stable links to content. The content that the links refer to is then archived so if the original link doesn&#8217;t resolve then users can still get to the archived content.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new idea: bookmarking services often archive bookmarked content to build personal archives; other citation and linking services have offered similar features that handle content going offline.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not that hard to implement. Creating link aliases is easy. Archiving content is less easy but is easily achievable for well-known formats and common cases: it gets harder if you have to deal with dynamic resources/content, or want to preserve a range of formats for the long term.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less easy to build stable commercial entities. It&#8217;s also tricky dealing with rights issues. Archival organisations often ensure that they have rights to preserve content, e.g. by having agreements with data publishers.</p>
<p>Personally I&#8217;m not convinced that perma.cc have nailed that aspect yet.Â If you look at their <a href="http://www.perma.cc/static/doc/Perma.cc_TOS.pdf">terms of service</a> (PDF, 23rd Sept 2013), I think there are some problems:</p>
<p>You may use the service &#8220;<em>only for non-commercial scholarly and research purposes that doÂ not infringe or violate anyoneâs copyright or other rights</em>&#8220;. Defining &#8220;non-commercial&#8221; use is very tricky, it&#8217;s an issue with many open content and data licenses. One might argue that a publisher creating perma.cc links is using it for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>But I find Section 5 &#8220;User Submitted Content and Licensing&#8221; confusing. For example it seems to suggest that I either have to own the content that I am creating a perma.cc link for, or that I&#8217;ve done all the rights clearance on behalf of perma.cc.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how that can possibly work in the general case. Particularly as you must also grant perma.cc a license to use the content however they wish. If you&#8217;re trying to build perma.cc links to 3rd party content, e.g. many of the scenarios described in the New York Times article, then <em>you</em> don&#8217;t have any rights to grant them. Even if its published under an open content license you may not have all the rights they require.</p>
<p>They also reserve the right to remove any content, and presumably links, that they&#8217;re required to remove. From a legal perspective this makes some sense, but I&#8217;d be interested to know how that works in practice. For example will the perma.cc link just disappear or will there be any history available?</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m misunderstanding the terms (entirely possible) or the intended users of the service, I&#8217;d be interested in hearing any clarifications.</p>
<p>My general point here is not to be overly critical of perma.cc &#8212; I&#8217;m largely just confused by their terms. My pointis that bringing permanence to (parts of) the web isn&#8217;t necessarily a technical issue to solve, its one that has important legal, social and economic aspects.</p>
<p>Signing up to a service to create links is easy. Longevity is harder to achieve.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/929/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/929/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=929&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the following is my own perspective on the build &amp; design of the <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk">Ordnance Survey Linked Data</a> platform. I don&#8217;t presume to speak for the OS and don&#8217;t have any inside knowledge of their long term plans.</p>
<p>Having said that I wanted to share some of the goals we (<a href="http://julianhigman.com/blog/">Julian Higman</a>, <a href="http://bnowack.de/">Benjamin Nowack</a> and myself) had when approaching the design of the platform. I will say that we had the full support and encouragement of the Ordnance Survey throughout the project, especially <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/johngoodwin">John Goodwin</a> and others in the product management team.</p>
<h2>Background &amp; Goals</h2>
<p>The original Ordnance Survey Linked Data site launched in April 2010. At the time it was a leading example of adoption of Linked Data by a public sector organisation. But time moves on and both the site and the data were due for a refresh. With Talis&#8217; withdrawal from the data hosting business, the OS decided to bring the data hosting in-house and contracted Julian, Benjamin and myself to carry out the work.</p>
<p>While the migration from Talis was a key driver, the overall goal was to deliver a new Linked Data platform that would make a great showcase for the Ordnance Survey Linked Data. The beta of the new site was <a href="http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2013/04/launching-a-new-linked-data-service/">launched in April</a> and went properly <a href="http://blog.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/2013/06/new-linked-data-service-launches/">live at the beginning of June</a>.</p>
<p>We had a number of high-level goals that we set out to achieve in the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Provide value for everyone, not just developers</em> &#8212; the original site was very developer-centric, offering a very limited user experience with no easy way to browse the data. We wanted everyone to begin sharing links to the Ordnance Survey pages and that meant that the site needed a clean, user-friendly design. This meant we approached it from the point of building an application, not just a data portal</li>
<li><em>Deliver more than Linked Data</em> &#8212; we wanted to offer a set of APIs that made the data accessible and useful for people who weren&#8217;t familiar with Linked Data or SPARQL. This meant offering some simpler tools to enable people to search and link to the data</li>
<li><em>Deliver a good developer user experience</em> &#8211;this meant integrating API explorers, plenty of examples, and clear documentation. We wanted to shorten the &#8220;time to first JSON&#8221; to get developers into the data as fast as possible</li>
<li><em>Showcase the OS services and products</em> &#8212; the OS offer a number of other web services and location products. The data should provide a way to show that value. Integrating mapping tools was the obvious first step</li>
<li><em>Support latest standards and best practices</em> &#8212; where possible we wanted to make sure that the site offered standard APIs and formats, and conformed to the latest best practices around open data publishing</li>
<li><em>Support multiple datasets</em> &#8212; the platform has been designed to support multiple datasets, allowing users to use just the data they need or the whole combined dataset. This provides more options for both publishing and consuming the data</li>
<li><em>Build a solid platform to support further innovation</em> &#8212; we wanted to leave the OS with an extensible, scalable platform to allow them to further experiment with Linked Data</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-size:1.5em;">Best Practices &amp; Standards</span></h2>
<p>From a technical perspective we need to refresh not just the data but the APIs used to access it. This meant replacing the SPARQL 1.0 endpoint and custom search interface offered in the original with more standard APIs.</p>
<p>We also wanted to make the data and APIs <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/02/04/dataset-and-api-discovery-in-linked-data/">discoverable</a> and adopted a &#8220;completionist&#8221; approach to try and tick all the boxes for publishing and exposing dataset metadata, including basic versioning and licensing information.</p>
<p>As a result we ended up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL 1.1 query</a> endpoints for every dataset, which expose a basic <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/">SPARQL 1.1 Service Description</a> as well as the newer <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/">CSV and TSV response formats</a></li>
<li>Well populated <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/">VoID</a> descriptions for each dataset, including all of the key metadata items including publication dates, licensing, coverage, and some initial dataset statistics</li>
<li><a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/dataset-autodiscovery.html">Autodiscovery support for datasets</a>, APIs,Â and for underlying data aboutÂ <a href="http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/autodiscovery.html">individual Linked Data resources</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1">OpenSearch 1.1</a> compliant search APIs that support keyword and geo search over the data. The Atom and RSS response formats include the <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Relevance/1.0">relevance</a> and <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/Extensions/Geo/1.0/Draft_2">geo</a> extensions</li>
<li>Licensing metadata is clearly labelled not just on the datasets, but as a Link HTTP header in every Linked Data or API result, so you can <a href="http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2013/05/29/tip-probe-web-resources-head-options-rest/">probe resources</a> to learn more</li>
<li>Basic support for the<a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconciliation-Service-API"> OpenRefine Reconciliation API</a> as a means to offer a simple linking API that can be used in a variety of applications but also, importantly, with people curating and publishing small datasets using <a href="http://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a></li>
<li>Support for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a>, allowing cross-browser requests to be made to the Linked Data and all of the APIs</li>
<li>Caching support through the use of ETags and Last-Modified headers. If you&#8217;re using the APIs then you can optimise your requests and cache data by making Conditional GET requests</li>
<li>Linked Data pages that offer more than just a data dump, the integrated mapping and links to other products and services makes the data more engaging.</li>
<li>Custom ontology pages that allow you to explore terms and classes within individual ontologies, e.g. see for example the definition of &#8220;<a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/admingeo/LondonBorough">London Borough</a>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly there&#8217;s more that could be potentially done. Tools can always be improved, but the best way for that to happen is through user feedback. I&#8217;d love to know what you think of the platform.</p>
<p>Overall I think we&#8217;ve achieved our goal of making a site that, while clearly developer oriented, offers a good user experience for non-developers. I&#8217;ll be interested to see what people do with the data over the coming months</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/921/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/921/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=921&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In &#8220;<a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/03/04/what-does-a-dataset-contain/">What Does Your Dataset Contain?</a>&#8221; I outlined a conceptual framework for thinking about how we might want to describe datasets, e.g. how they&#8217;re produced, what they contain, etc. I&#8217;ve been reading with interest the series on<a href="http://blog.scraperwiki.com/2013/05/14/summarise-4-images-and-domains/"> dataset summaries in Scraperwiki</a> which is exploring similar ideas.</p>
<p>I finally found the time to do some quick practical exploration of my own. One area that interests me is understanding the geographic coverage of a dataset. There&#8217;s lots of ways to approach that, mainly because datasets can vary widely in how they include geographical data. Some might include direct references to regions, whilst others might have more fine-grained latitude/longitude data.</p>
<p>I recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/aishfenton/local-geocoder">local-geocoder </a>which allows bulk reverse geocoding of lat/lng data to country names. I decided to apply this to data to dbpedia to see if I could get a sense of its overall coverage.</p>
<p>The result is a simple shell script that:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Downloads the geographic data from the English version of Dbpedia 3.8</span></li>
<li>Extracts the georss:point predicates and runs them through the local_geocode command-line tool</li>
<li>Runs the results through some command-line tools to sort and summarise the data to create a simple CSV file</li>
</ol>
<p>I created a gist that contains the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ldodds/5583004">script and the output</a>Â as formatted text and CSV.</p>
<p>Quick summary of the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>475,001 geographic points in Dbpedia 3.8.</li>
<li>26,763 (recorded as &#8220;nil&#8221; in the results) were unmatched, giving 448,238 points that can be geocoded to a country</li>
<li>122,230 points were from US (25.7% of full set)</li>
<li>US, Poland (46,316; 9.75%), and United Kingdom (45,917, 9.67%) are the three most represented countries</li>
<li>178 countries referenced in totaal</li>
</ul>
<p>From a quick inspection, I think the results that can&#8217;t be geocoded are simply those that are outside country boundaries. E.g. the location for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_8">Apollo 8</a> is the middle of the Pacific).</p>
<p>The main caveat with the results (other than potential bugs) is thatÂ <a href="https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json">the boundary data used in local-geocoder</a> is of unclear provenance. Its <a href="https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/issues/12">intended for quick prototyping only</a>. However I&#8217;ve had a <a href="https://github.com/aishfenton/local-geocoder/pull/1">pull request accepted</a> to local-geocoder to make it easier to use alternate data so there are now options to use alternative sources.</p>
<p>Most online geocoders are rate-limited or have specific terms and conditions that limit re-use of the resulting data. It would be interesting to create a good reference set of open boundary data for countries and administrative regions for use in open source geocoding tools.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been exploring how the Ordnance Survey data could be converted to GeoJSON for use with the tool. This would give more fine-grained data for England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is another in my ongoing series of &#8220;basic questions about open data&#8221;, which includes &#8220;<a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/02/09/what-is-a-dataset/">What is a Dataset?</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/03/04/what-does-a-dataset-contain/">What does a dataset contain?</a>&#8220;. In this post I want to focus on dataset attribution and in particular questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Why should we attribute data?</span></li>
<li>How are data publishers asking to be attributed?</li>
<li>What are some of the issues with attribution?</li>
<li>Can we identify some common conventions around attribution?</li>
<li>Can we monitor or track attribution?</li>
</ul>
<p>I started to think about this because I&#8217;ve encountered a number of data publishers recently that have published Open Data but are now struggling to highlight how and where that data has been used or consumed. If data is published for anonymous download, or accessible through an open API then a data publisher only has usage logs to draw on.</p>
<p>I had thought that attribution might help here: if we can find links back to sources, then perhaps we can help data publishers mine the web for links and help them build evidence of usage. But it quickly became clear, as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, that there really aren&#8217;t any conventions around attribution, making it difficult to achieve this.</p>
<p>So lets explore the topic from first principles and tick off my questions individually.</p>
<h2>Why Attribute?</h2>
<p>The obvious answer here is simply that if we are building on the work of others, then it&#8217;s only fair that those efforts should be acknowledged. This helps the creator of the data (or work, or code) be recognised for their creativity and effort, which is the very least we can do if we&#8217;re not exchanging hard cash.</p>
<p>There are also legal reasons why the source of some data might be need to be acknowledged. Some licenses require attribution, copyright may need to be acknowledged. As a consumer I might also want to (or need to) clearly indicate that I am not the originator of some data in case it is find to be false, or misleading, etc.</p>
<p>Acknowledging my sources may also help guarantee that the data I&#8217;m using continues to be available: a data publisher might be collecting evidence of successful re-use in order to justify ongoing budget for data collection, curation and publishing. This is especially true when the data publisher is not directly benefiting from the data supply; and I think it&#8217;s almost always true for public sector data. If I&#8217;m reusing some data I should make it as clear as possible that I&#8217;m so doing.<i><br /> </i></p>
<p>There&#8217;s some additional useful background on attribution from a public sector perspective in a document called &#8220;<a href="http://epsiplatform.eu/content/cc-tools-and-psi-supporting-attribution-protecting-reputation-and-preserving-integrity">Supporting attribution, protecting reputation, and preserving integrity</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>It might also be useful to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;"><strong>Attribution</strong> &#8212; highlighting the creator/publisher of some data to acknowledge their efforts, conferring reputation</span></li>
<li><strong>Citation</strong> &#8212; providing a link or reference to the data itself, in order to communicate provenance or drive discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>While these two cases clearly overlap, the intention is often slightly different. As a user of an application, or the reader of an academic paper, I might want a clear citation to the underlying dataset so I can re-use it myself, or do some fact checking. The important use case there is tracking facts and figures back to their sources. Attribution is more about crediting the effort involved in collecting that information.</p>
<p>It may be possible to achieve both goals with a simple link, but I think recognising the different use cases is important.</p>
<h2>How are data publishers asking to be attributed?</h2>
<p>So how are data publishers asking for attribution?Â What follows isn&#8217;t an exhaustive survey but should hopefully illustrate some of the variety.</p>
<p>Lets look first at some of the suggested wordings in some common Open Data licenses, then poke around in some terms and conditions to see how these are being applied in practice.</p>
<h3>Attribution Statements in Common Open Data Licenses</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/">Open Data Commons Attribution license</a> includes some recommended text (Section 4.3a &#8211; Example Notice):</p>
<blockquote><p>Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available under the ODC Attribution License.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where DATABASE NAME is the name of the dataset and is linked to the dataset homepage. Notice no mention of the originator, just the database. The license notes that in plain text the links should be included as text. The <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">Open Data Commons Database license</a> has the same text (again, section 4.3a)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/">UK Open Government License</a> notes that re-users should:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;acknowledge the source of the Information by including any attribution statement specified by the Information Provider(s)Â and, where possible, provide a link to this licence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where no attribution is provided, or multiple sources must be attributed, then the suggested default text, which should include a link to the license is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v1.0.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, no reference to the publisher but also no reference to the dataset either. The <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/government-licensing/attributions.htm">National Archives have some guidance on attribution</a> which includes some other variations. Â These variants do suggest including more detail including name of department, date of publication, etc. These look more like typical bibliographic citations.</p>
<p>As another data point we can look at the <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/docs/licences/os-opendata-licence.pdf">Ordnance Survey Open Data License</a>. This is a variation of the Open Government License but carries some additional requirements, specifically around attribution. The basic attribution statement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contains Ordnance Survey data Â© Crown copyright and database right [year]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the Code Point Open dataset has some additional attribution requirements, which also acknowledge copyright of the Royal Mail and National Statistics. All of these statements acknowledge the originators and there&#8217;s no requirement to cite the dataset itself.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while the previous licenses state that re-publication of data should be under a compatible license, only the OS Open Data license explicitly notes that the attribution statements must also be preserved. So both the license and attribution have viral qualities.</p>
<h3>Attribution Statements in Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Now lets look at some specific Open Data services to see what attribution provisions they include.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freebase.com/">Freebase</a> is an interesting example. It draws on multiple datasets which are supplemented by contributions of its user community. Some of that data is under different licenses. As you can see from <a href="http://www.freebase.com/policies">their attribution page</a>, there are variants in attribution statements depending on whether the data is about one or several resources and whether it includes Wikipedia content, which must be specially acknowledged.</p>
<p>They provide a handy HTML snippet for you to include in your webpage to make sure you get the attribution exactly right. Ironically at the time of writing this service is broken (&#8220;User Rate Limit Exceeded&#8221;). If you want a slightly different attribution, then you&#8217;re asked to contact them.</p>
<p>Now, while Freebase might not meet everyone&#8217;s definition of Open Data, its an interesting data point. Â Particularly as they ask for deep links back to the dataset, as well as having a clear expectation of where/how the attribution will be surfaced.</p>
<p><a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> is another illustrative example. Their <a href="http://opencorporates.com/info/licence">legal/license info</a> page examples that their dataset is licensed under the Open Data Commons Database License and explains that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Use of any data must be accompanied by a hyperlink reading &#8220;from OpenCorporates&#8221; and linking to either theÂ OpenCorporatesÂ homepage or the page referring to the information in question</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also clear expectations around the visibility of that attribution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The attribution must be no smaller than 70% of the size of the largest bit of information used, or 7px, whichever is larger. If you are making the information available via your own API you need to make sure your users comply with all these conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is a clear expectation that the attribution should be displayed alongside any data. Like the OS license these attribution requirements are also viral as they must be passed on by aggregators.</p>
<p>My intention isn&#8217;t to criticise either OpenCorporates or Freebase, but merely to highlight some real world examples.</p>
<h2>What are some of the issues with data attribution?</h2>
<p>Clearly we could undertake a much more thorough review than I have done here. But this is sufficient to highlight what I think are some of the key issues. Put yourself in the position of a developer consuming some Open Data under any or all of these conditions. How do you responsibly provide attribution?</p>
<p>The questions that occur to me, at least are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Do I need to put attribution on every page of my application, or can I simply add it to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)">colophon</a>? (Aside: <a href="http://lanyrd.com/colophon/">lanyrd has a great colophon page</a>). In some cases it seems like I might have some freedom of choice, in others I don&#8217;t</span></li>
<li>If I do have to put a link or some text on a page, then do I have any flexibility around its size, positioning, visibility, etc? Again, in some cases I may do, but in others I have some clear guidance to follow. This might be challenging if I&#8217;m creating a mobile application with limited screen space. Or creating a voice or SMS application.</li>
<li>What if I just re-use the data as part of some back-end analysis, but none of that data is actually surfaced to the user? How do I attribute in this scenario?</li>
<li>Do I need to acknowledge the publisher, or a link to the source page(s)?</li>
<li>What if I need to address multiple requirements, e.g. if I mashed up data from data.gov.uk, the Ordnance Survey, Freebase and OpenCorporates? That might get awkward.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no clear answers to these questions. For individual datasets I might be able to get guidance, but it requires me to read the detailed terms and conditions for the dataset or API I&#8217;m using. Isn&#8217;t the whole purpose in having off-the-shelf licenses like the OGL or ODbL supposed to help us streamline data sharing? Attribution, or rather unclear or overly detailed attribution requirements are a clear source of friction. Especially if there are legal consequences for getting it wrong.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just when we&#8217;re considering integrating data sources <em>by hand</em>. What about if we want to automatically combine data? How is a machine going to understand these conditions?Â I suspect that every Linked Data browser and application fails to comply with the attribution requirements of the data its consuming.</p>
<p>Of course these issues have been explored already. The <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/">Science Commons Protocol</a>Â encourages publishing data into the public domain &#8212; so no legal requirement for attribution at all. It also acknowledges the &#8220;Attribution Stacking&#8221; problem (section 5.3) which occurs when trying to attribute large numbers of datasets, each with their own requirements. Too much friction discourages use, whether its research or commercial.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the recently published <a href="http://www.force11.org/AmsterdamManifesto">Amsterdam Manifesto</a> on data citation seems to overlook these issues, requiring <em>all</em> authors/contributors to be attributed.</p>
<p>The scientific community may be more comfortable with a public domain licensing approach and a best effort attribution model because it is supported by strong social norms: citation and attribution is essential to scientific discourse. We don&#8217;t have anything like that in the broader open data community. Maybe its not achievable, but it seems like clear guidance would be very useful.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some useful background on problems with attribution and marking requirements on the Creative Commons wiki that also references some <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0/Attribution_and_marking">possible amendments and clarifications</a>.</p>
<h2>Can we convergence on some common conventions?</h2>
<p>So would it be possible to converge on a simple set of conventions or norms around data re-use? Ideally to the extent that attribution can be simplified and ideally automated as far as possible.</p>
<p>How about the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Publishers should clearly describe their attribution requirements. Ideally this should be a short simple statement (similar to the Open Government License) which includes their name and a link to their homepage. This attribution could be included anywhere on the web site or application that consumes the data.</span></li>
<li>Publishers should be aware that the consumers of their data will be doing so in a variety of applications and on a variety of platforms. This means allowing a deal of flexibility around how/where attribution is displayed.</li>
<li>Publishers should clearly indicate whether attribution must be passed on to down-stream users</li>
<li>Publishers should separately document their citation requirements. If they want to encourage users to link to the dataset, or an individual page on their site, to allow users to find the original context, then they should publish instructions on how to do it. However this kind of linking is for citation so consumers should be bound to include it</li>
<li>Consumers should comply with publishers wishes and include an about page on their site or within their application that attributes the originators of the data they use. Where feasible they should <em>also</em> provide citations to specific resources or datasets from within their applications. This providesÂ <em>their</em> users with clear citations to sources of data</li>
<li>Both sides should collaborate on structured markup to support publication of these attribution and citation requirements, as well as harvesting of links</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether attribution should be a legally enforced is another discussion. Personally I&#8217;d be keen to see a common set of conventions regardless of the legal basis for doing it. Attribution should be a social norm that we encourage, strongly, in order to acknowledge the sources of our Open Data.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/783/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/783/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=783&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently completed my first online course (or &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>&#8220;) on Coursera. It was an interesting experience and wanted to share some thoughts here.</p>
<p>I decided to take an online course for several reasons. Firstly the topic, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/astrobio">Astrobiology</a>, was fun and I thought the short course might make an interesting alternative to watching BBC documentaries and US TV box sets. I certainly wasn&#8217;t disappointed as the course content was accessible and well-presented. As a biology graduate I found much of the content was fairly entry-level, but it was nevertheless a good refresher in a number of areas. The mix of biology, astronomy, chemistry and geology was really interesting. The course was very well attended, with around <a href="http://www.astrobiology.ac.uk/2013/02/01/astrobiology-course-begins/">40,000 registrants and 16,000 active students</a>.</p>
<p>The second reason I wanted to try a course was because MOOCs are so popular at the moment. I was curious how well an online course would work, in terms of both content delivery and the social aspects of learning. Many courses are longer and are more rigorously marked and assessed, but the short Astrobiology course looked like it would still offer some useful insights into online learning.</p>
<p>Clearly some of my experiences will be specific to the particular course and Coursera, but I think some of the comments below will generalise to other platforms.</p>
<p>Firstly, the positives:</p>
<ul>
<li>The course material was clear and well presented</li>
<li>The course tutors appeared to be engaged and actively participated in discussions</li>
<li>The ability to download the video lectures, allowing me to (re)view content whilst travelling was really appreciated. Flexibility around consuming course content seems like an essential feature to me. While the online experience will undoubtedly be richer, I&#8217;m guessing that many people are doing these courses in spare time around other activities. With this in mind, video content needs to be available in easily downloadable chunks.</li>
<li>The Coursera site itself was on the whole well constructed. It was easy to navigate to the content, tests and the discussions. The service offered timely notifications that new content and assessments had been published</li>
<li>Although I didn&#8217;t use it myself, the site offered good integration with services like Meetup, allowing students to start their own local groups. This seemed like a good feature, particularly for longer running courses.</li>
</ul>
<p>However there were a number of areas in which I thought things could be greatly improved:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">The online discussion forums very quickly became unmanageable. With so many people contributing, across many different threads, it&#8217;s hard to separate the signal from the noise. The community had some interesting extremes: people associated with the early NASA programme, through to alien contact and conspiracy theory nut-cases. While those particular extremes are peculiar to this course, I expect other courses may experience similar challenges</span></li>
<li>Related to the above point, the ability to post anonymously in forums lead to trolling on a number of occasions. I&#8217;m sensitive to privacy, but perhaps pseudonyms may be better than anonymity?</li>
<li>The discussions are divorced from the content, e.g. I can&#8217;t comment directly on a video I have to create a new thread for it in a discussion group. I wanted to see something more sophisticated, maybe SoundCloud style annotations on the videos or per-video discussion threads.</li>
<li>No integration with wider social networks: there were discussions also happening on twitter, G+ and Facebook. Maybe its better to just integrate those, rather than offer a separate discussion forum?</li>
<li>Students consumed content at different rates which meant that some discussions contained &#8220;spoilers&#8221; for material I hadn&#8217;t yet watched. This is largely a side-effect of the discussions happening independently from the content.</li>
<li>Coursera offered a course wiki but this seemed useless</li>
<li>It wasn&#8217;t clear to me during the course what would happen to the discussions after the course ended. Would they be wiped out, preserved, or would later students build on what was there already? Now that it&#8217;s finished it looks each course is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_dungeon">instanced</a>Â and discussions are preserved as an archive. I&#8217;m not sure what the right option is there. Starting with a clean slate seems like a good default, but can particularly useful discussions be highlighted in later courses? Seems like the course discussions would be an interesting thing to mine for links and topics, especially for lecturers</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some interesting challenges with designing this kind of product. Unlike almost every other social application the communities for these courses don&#8217;t ramp up over time: they arrive <em>en masse</em> at a particular date and then more or less evaporate over night.</p>
<p>As a member of that community this makes it very hard to identify which people in the community are worth listening too and who to ignore: all of a sudden I&#8217;m surrounded by 16000 people all talking at once. When things ramp up more slowly, I can build out my social network more easily. Coursera doesn&#8217;t have any notion of study groups.</p>
<p>I expect the lecturers must have similar challenges as very quickly they&#8217;re faced with a lot of material that they might have to potentially read, review and respond to. This must present challenges when engaging with each new intake.</p>
<p>While a traditional discussion forum might provide the basic infrastructure for enabling the necessary basic communication, MOOC platforms need to have more nuanced social features &#8212; for both students and lecturers &#8212; to support the community. Features that are sensitive to the sudden growth of the community. I found myself wanting to find out things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Who is posting on which topics and how frequently?</span></li>
<li>Which commentators are getting up-voted (or down-voted) the most?</li>
<li>Which community members are at the same stage in the course as me?</li>
<li>Which community members have something to offer on a particular topic, e.g. because of their specific background?</li>
<li>What links are people sharing in discussions? Perhaps filtered by users.</li>
<li>What courses are my fellow students undertaking next? Are there shared journeys?</li>
<li>Is there anyone watching this material at the same time?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering all of these requires more than just mining discussions but it feels like some useful metrics could be nevertheless.Â For example, one common use of the forums was to share additional material, e.g. recent news reports, scientific papers, you tube videos, etc. That kind of content could either be collected in other ways, e.g. via a shared reading list, or as a list that is automatically surfaced from discussions. I ended up sifting through the forums and creating <a href="http://readlists.com/fcf9d332/">a reading list on readlists</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfqsYOp88r66uS4l_8z5Hu-NECIMQFyE">a YouTube playlist</a>Â just to see whether others would find them useful (they did).</p>
<p>All of these challenges we can see playing out in wider social media, but with a MOOC they&#8217;re often compressed into relatively short time spans.</p>
<p>(Perhaps inevitably) I also kept thinking that much of the process of creating, delivering and consuming the content could be improved with better linking and annotation tools. Indeed, do we even need specialised MOOC platforms at all? Why not just place all of the content on services like YouTube, ReadLists, etc. Isn&#8217;t the web our learning infrastructure?</p>
<p>Well I think there <em>is</em> a role for these platforms. The role in certification &#8212; these people have taken this course &#8212; is clearly going to become more important, for example.</p>
<p>However I think their real value is in marking out a space within which the learning experience takes place: these people are taking this content during this period. The community needs a focal point, even if its short-lived.</p>
<p>If everything was just on the web, with no real definition to the course, then that completely dissolves the community experience.Â By concentrating the community into time-boxed, instanced courses, it creates focus that can enrich the experience. The challenge is balancing unwieldy MOOC &#8220;flashmobs&#8221; against a more diffused internet community.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/750/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/750/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=750&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<description><![CDATA[So earlier today Thayer askedÂ if I had any suggestions for things to do in Minecraft for younger kids.

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So earlier today <a href="https://twitter.com/thayer">Thayer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Thayer/status/309941640443858944">asked</a>Â if I had any suggestions for things to do in Minecraft for younger kids. I thought I might as well write this up as a blog post rather than a long email, then everyone else can add their suggestions too.</p>
<p>Of course, the first thing I did was turn to the experts: my kids. Both my son and daughter have been addicted to Minecraft for some time now. We run our own home server and this gets visits from my son&#8217;s friends too. They also play on-line, but having a local server gives us a nice safe environment where we can play with the latest plugins and releases.</p>
<p>So most of the list below was suggested by the kids. I&#8217;ve just written it up and added in the links. We&#8217;ve assumed that Thayer and Nemi (and you) are playing on the &#8220;vanilla&#8221; (i.e. out of the box, un-patched) PC version of Minecraft.Â The browser, XBox, mobile and the Raspberry Pi versions lag behind a little bit so not all of these activities or options might be available.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a lot more fun to be had exploring many of the amazing mods, maps and mod-packs (bundled packages of mods) that the Minecraft community has shared. The kids are currently obsessed with the <a href="http://voidswrath.com">Voids Wrath</a> mod pack which has some excellent RPG features. But we decided to focus on the vanilla experience first.</p>
<h2>Be Creative</h2>
<p>There are lots of ways to play Minecraft. You can opt to build things, undertake survival challenges, explore above and below ground, and push the limits of its sandbox environment in lots of different ways.</p>
<p>But for younger kids we thought it would be best to play on <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Creative">Creative</a> and <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Peaceful_mode">Peaceful</a> mode. Creative mode removes the survival challenge aspects, allowing you to focus on building and exploration. In Creative mode you have instant access to every block, tool, weapon, etc. in the game. So you can cut to the chase and start building, rather than undertaking a lot of mining and exploring at the start. Peaceful mode disables all of the naturally spawning enemies, meaning you don&#8217;t have to worry about being killed by skeletons, exploded by creepers or going hungry whilst travelling.</p>
<p>The Creative mode inventory system can be a little daunting: there are a lot of different blocks in the game. But if you use the compass to activate the search, you can quickly find what you&#8217;re looking for. The <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Blocks">list of blocks</a> is on the wiki, so that can also be a handy reference.</p>
<h2>Build a House</h2>
<p>Building a house is obviously the first place to start. Building and decorating a house gives you a base of operations for all your other activities.</p>
<p>There are lots of material to choose from, including varieties of stone, wood, and even glass. Use different coloured wools to make carpets, and then add <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Bookshelf">book shelves</a>, <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Picture">paintings</a>, <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Bed">beds</a>Â (right click to sleep in it), a <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Jukebox">jukebox</a>, and lots of other types of <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Furniture">furniture</a>.</p>
<p>The minecraft wiki has a good starting reference for building <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Shelters">types of shelter</a></p>
<h2>Become a farmer</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve built a house, you can next turn your hand to a spot of gardening and become a farmer.</p>
<p>Using a hoe, some water, some earth and the right kinds of seeds you can grow all kinds of things, including <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Wheat">Wheat</a>, <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Carrots">Carrots</a>, <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Cactus">Cacti</a>, <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Melon_(Block)">Melons</a> and even <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Mushrooms">mushrooms</a>. You can even grow <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Huge_Mushrooms">giant mushrooms</a> for that fairy tale feel.</p>
<p>You can use a <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Bucket">bucket</a> to carry water around to water your garden or to create a pool.</p>
<h2>Build a Zoo</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re not limited to plants. Minecraft has a lot of different types of animals, including pigs, sheep, cows, wolves and ocelots(?!). In Minecraft every animal can be hatched from an egg (unless you breed them).</p>
<p>In Creative mode you have access to <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Spawn_Egg">Spawn Eggs</a> which you can use to spawn animals. So build you zoo enclosures and then fill them with whatever animals you like.</p>
<h2>Tame animals for Pets</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Wolf">Wolves</a> and ocelots can be tamed to make pets. You can do this if you discover them in the wild or just try taming some animals from your zoo. <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Wolf#Taming.2C_health_and_feeding">Feed a wolf a bone</a> and it&#8217;ll be come a pet dog. If you want a pet cat, then you&#8217;ll want to <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Ocelot#Taming">tame an ocelot</a> with some raw fish. Pets will follow you around and you can make your pet dog sit and stay, or follow you on adventures.</p>
<h2>Ride a Pig</h2>
<p>While we&#8217;re talking about animals, why not give <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Pig#Riding_pigs">Pig riding</a> a try? You&#8217;ll be needing a saddle and a carrot on a stick.</p>
<h2>Build something amazing</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re only limited by your imagination when crafting giant castles, houses, hotels, beach resorts, tree houses, or models of your own home and garden. Using creative mode you&#8217;ll have full access to all the tools you need. Moving water and lava around using a bucket you can create some really cool landscapes.</p>
<p>If you need some space then you can create a &#8220;<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Superflat_world">Superflat</a>&#8221; world, using the advanced options in the game menu. This creates a basic, flat world that gives you plenty of space to build, but you won&#8217;t get any of those amazing Minecraft landscapes. Speaking of which&#8230;</p>
<h2>Fly around the world</h2>
<p>Roaming around on foot is great for exploring, but you can&#8217;t beat flying. <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Flying">Flying</a> is another bonus of creative mode and it&#8217;ll let you quickly explore huge areas to find the best place for your next awesome build. Don&#8217;t forget to pull out a <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Map">map</a> and a <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Compass">compass</a> from your inventory. The map will give you a birds-eye view, while the compass will always point to home (e.g. where you last slept).</p>
<h2>Other Ideas</h2>
<p>Some other ideas we had:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Once you&#8217;ve mastered flying, then you could try and create some Minecraft pixel art</span></li>
<li>You might also want to change the <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Skin">skin</a> in your minecraft account. There&#8217;s lots of sites and apps that provide tools for building and changing skins to your favourite characters.</li>
<li>You could also try out an alternative look-and-feel for Minecraft by installing a texture pack. While installing them will probably need some adult help, once installed its easy to switch between them. Then you make Minecraft look more like <a href="http://www.minecraftdl.com/pokemon-works-texture-pack/">Pokemon</a>Â or maybe just give it a more <a href="http://www.minecraftdl.com/babys-first-texture-pack/">child friendly </a>feel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those were just our ideas. If you&#8217;ve got other suggestions for younger kids, or starting player, then feel free to leave a comment below.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/773/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/773/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=773&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having explored some ways that we might find <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/02/04/dataset-and-api-discovery-in-linked-data/">related data and services</a>, as well as different <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/02/09/what-is-a-dataset/">definitions of &#8220;dataset&#8221;</a>, I wanted to look at the topic of dataset description and analysis. Specifically, how can we answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>what kinds of information does this dataset contain?</li>
<li>what types of entity are described in this dataset?</li>
<li>how can I determine if this dataset will fulfil my requirements?</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s been plenty of work done around trying to capture dataset metadata, e.g.Â <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void">VoiD</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a>;Â there&#8217;s also the upcoming working on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/04/odw/">Open Data on the Web</a>. Much of that work has focused on capturing the core metadata about a dataset, e.g. who published it, when was it last updated, where can I find the data files, etc. But there&#8217;s still plenty of work to be done here, to encourage broader adoption of best practices, and also to explore ways to expose more information about the internals of a dataset.</p>
<p>This is a topic I&#8217;ve touched on before, and which we experimented with in Kasabi. I wanted to move &#8220;<a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2011/09/28/beyond-the-triple-count/">beyond the triple count</a>&#8221; and provide a &#8220;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ldodds/the-rdf-report-card-beyond-the-triple-count">report card</a>&#8221; that gave a little more insight into a dataset. A report card could usefully complement an ODI <a href="https://github.com/theodi/open-data-certificate">Open Data Certificate</a>, for example. Understanding the composition of a dataset can also help support new ways of <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2012/05/03/layered-data-a-paper-some-commentary/">manipulating and combining datasets</a>.</p>
<p>In this post I want to propose a conceptual framework for capturing metadata about datasets. Its intended as a discussion point, so I&#8217;m interested in getting feedback. (I would have submitted this to the ODW workshop but ran out of time before the deadline).</p>
<p>At the top level I think there are five broad categories of dataset information: Descriptive Data; Access Information; Indicators; Compositional Data; and Relationships. Compositional data can be broken down into smaller categories &#8212; this is what I described as an &#8220;information spectrum&#8221; in the <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2011/09/28/beyond-the-triple-count/">Beyond the Triple Count</a> post.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;ve thought about this largely from the perspective of Linked Data, I think its applicable to any format/technology.</p>
<h2>Descriptive Data</h2>
<p>This kind of information helps us understand a dataset as a &#8220;work&#8221;: its name, a human-readable description or summary, its license, and pointers to other relevant documentation such as quality control or feedback processes. This information is typically created and maintained directly by the data publisher, whereas the other categories of data I describe here can potentially be derived automatically by data analysis</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Title</span></li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>License</li>
<li>Publisher</li>
<li>Subject Categories</li>
</ul>
<h2>Access Information</h2>
<p>Basically, where do I get the data?</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Where do I download the latest data?</span></li>
<li>Where can I download archived or previous versions of the data?</li>
<li>Are there mirrors for the dataset?</li>
<li>Are there APIs that use this data?</li>
<li>How do I obtain access to the data or API?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Indicators</h2>
<p>This is statistical information that can help provide some insight into the data set, for example its size. But indicators can also build confidence in re-users by highlighting useful statistics such as the timeliness of releases, speed of responding to data fixes, etc.</p>
<p>While a data publisher might publish some of these indicators as targets that they are aiming to achieve, many of these figures could be derived automatically from an underlying publishing platform or service.</p>
<p>Examples of indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Size</li>
<li>Rate of Growth</li>
<li>Date of Last Update</li>
<li>Frequency of Updates</li>
<li>Number of Re-users (e.g. size of user community, or number of apps that use it)</li>
<li>Number of Contributors</li>
<li>Frequency of Use</li>
<li>Turn-around time for data fixes</li>
<li>Number of known errors</li>
<li>Availability (for API based access)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Relationship data primarily drives discovery use cases: to which other datasets does this dataset relate? For example the dataset might re-use identifiers or directly link to resources in other datasets. Knowing the source of that information can help us build trust in the reliability of the combined data, as well as give us sign-posts to other useful context. This is where Linked Data excels.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2009/12/16/annotated-data/">Annotation Datasets</a>Â provide context to, and enrich other reference datasets. Annotations might be limited to linking information (&#8220;Link Sets&#8221;) or they may add new facts/properties about existing resources. Independently sourced quality control information could be published as annotations.</p>
<p>Provenance is also a form of relationship information. Derived datasets, e.g. created through analysis or data conversions, should refer to their original input datasets, and ideally also the algorithms and/or code that were applied.</p>
<p>Again, much of this information can be derived from data analysis. Recommendations for relevant related datasets might be created based on existing links between datasets or by analysing usage patterns. Set algebra on URIs in datasets can be used to do analysis on their overlap, to discover linkages and to determine whether one dataset contains annotations of another.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">List of dataset(s) that this dataset draws on (e.g. re-uses identifiers, controlled vocabulary, etc)</span></li>
<li>List of datasets that this datasets references, e.g. via links</li>
<li>List of source datasets used to compile or create this dataset</li>
<li>List of datasets that link to this dataset (&#8220;back links&#8221;)</li>
<li>Which datasets are often used in conjunction with this dataset?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compositional Data</h2>
<p>This is information about the internals of a dataset: e.g. what kind of data does it contain, how is that data organized, and what kinds of things are being described?</p>
<p>This is the most complex area as there are potentially a number of different audiences and abilities to cater for. At one end of the spectrum we want to provide high level summaries of the contents of a dataset, while at the other end we want to provide detailed schema information to support developers. I&#8217;ve previously advocated a &#8220;progressive disclosure&#8221; approach to allow re-users to quickly find the data they need; a product manager looking for data to support a new feature will be looking for different information to a developer constructing queries over a dataset.</p>
<p>I think there are three broad ways that we can decompose Compositional Data further. There are particular questions and types of information that relate to each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;"><strong>Scope</strong> or <strong>Coverage</strong>Â </span>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">What kinds of things does this dataset describe? Is it people, places, or other objects? </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">How many of these things are in the dataset? </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Is there a geographical focus to the dataset, e.g. a county, region, country or is it global?</span></li>
<li>Is the data confined to a particular data period (archival data) or does it contain recent information?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>
<ul>
<li>What are some typical example records from the dataset?</li>
<li>What schema does it conform to?</li>
<li>What graph patterns (e.g. combinations of vocabularies) are commonly found in the data?</li>
<li>How are various types of resource related to one another?</li>
<li>What is the logical data model for the data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Internals</strong>
<ul>
<li>What RDF terms and vocabularies that are used in the data?</li>
<li>What formats are used for capturing dates, times, or other structured values?</li>
<li>Are there custom validation rules for particular fields or properties?</li>
<li>Are there caveats or qualifiers to individual schema elements or data items?</li>
<li>What is the physical data model</li>
<li>How is the dataset laid out in a particular database schema, across a collection of files, or named graphs?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The experiments we did in Kasabi around the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ldodds/the-rdf-report-card-beyond-the-triple-count">report card</a>Â (see the last slides for examples) were exploring ways to help visualise the <em>scope</em> of a dataset. It was based on identifying broad categories of entity in a dataset. I&#8217;m not sure we got the implementation quite right, but I think it was a useful visual indicator to help understand a dataset.</p>
<p>This is a project I plan to revive when I get some free time. Related to this is the work I did to <a href="https://github.com/ldodds/schema-icons">map the Schema.org Types to the Noun Project Icons</a>.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to present a framework that captures most,Â if not all of the kinds of questions that I&#8217;ve seen people ask when trying to get to grips with a new dataset. If we can understand the types of information people need and the questions they want to answer, then we can create a better set of data publishing and analysis tools.</p>
<p>To date, I think there&#8217;s been a tendency to focus on the Descriptive Data and Access Information &#8212; because we want to be able to discover data &#8212; and its Internals &#8212; so we know how to use it.</p>
<p>But for data to become more accessible to a non-technical audience we need to think about a broader range of information and how this might be surfaced by data publishing platforms.</p>
<p>If you have feedback on the framework, particularly if you think I&#8217;ve missed a category of information, then please leave a comment. The next step is to explore ways to automatically derive and surface some of this information.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/761/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/761/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=761&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/02/04/dataset-and-api-discovery-in-linked-data/">my last post</a> highlighted, I&#8217;ve been thinking about how we can find and discover datasets and their related APIs and services. I&#8217;m thinking of putting together some simple tools to help explore and encourage the kind of linking that <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2013/02/04/dataset-and-api-discovery-in-linked-data/">my diagram</a> illustrated.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some related work going on in a few areas which is also worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Within the<a href="http://data.gov.uk/linked-data/UKGovLD"> UK Government Linked Data</a> group there&#8217;s some work progressing around the notion of a &#8220;registry&#8221; for Linked Data that could be used to collect dataset metadata as well as supporting dataset discovery. There&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/der/ukl-registry-poc/wiki">a draft specification</a> which is open for comment. I&#8217;d recommend you ignore the term &#8220;registry&#8221; and see it more as a modular approach for supporting dataset discovery, lightweight Linked Data publishing, and &#8220;namespace management&#8221; (aka URL redirection). A registry function is really just one aspect of the model.</span></li>
<li>There&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/04/odw/">Open Data on the Web</a> workshop in April which will cover a range of topics including dataset discovery. My current thoughts are partly preparation for that event (and I&#8217;m on the Programme Committee)</li>
<li>There&#8217;s been some discussion and <a href="http://not-for-use-except-reviewing.appspot.com/Dataset">a draft proposal for adding the Dataset type</a> to Schema.org. This could result in the publication of more embedded metadata about datasets. I&#8217;m interested in tools that can extract that information and do something useful with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking about these topics I realised that there are many definitions of &#8220;dataset&#8221;. Unsurprisingly it means different things in different contexts. If we&#8217;re defining models, registries and markup for describing datasets we may need to get a sense of what these different definitions actually are.</p>
<p>As a result, I ended up looking around for a series of definitions and I thought I&#8217;d write them down here.</p>
<h2>Definitions of Dataset</h2>
<p>Lets start with the most basic, for example <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/data+set?s=ts">Dictionary.com has the following definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;aÂ collectionÂ ofÂ dataÂ recordsÂ forÂ computerÂ processing&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is pretty vague. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataSeT">Wikipedia has a definition</a> which derives from the terms use in a mainframe environment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A dataset (or data set) is a collection of data, usually presented in tabular form. Each column represents a particular variable. Each row corresponds to a given member of the dataset in question. It lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object. Each value is known as a datum. The dataset may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows.</p>
<p>Nontabular datasets can take the form of marked up strings of characters, such as an XML file.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class--dataset">W3C Data Catalog Vocabulary</a> defines a dataset as:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The JISC &#8220;Data Information Specialists Committee&#8221; have <a href="http://www.disc-uk.org/qanda.html">a definition of dataset</a>Â as:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;a group of data files&#8211;usually numeric or encoded&#8211;along with the documentation files (such as a codebook, technical or methodology report, data dictionary) which explain their production or use. Generally a dataset is un-usable for sound analysis by a second party unless it is well documented.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a good definition as it highlights that the dataset is more than just the individual data files or facts, it also consists of some documentation that supports its use or analysis. I also came across a document called &#8220;<a href="http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442458038">A guide to data development</a>&#8221; (2007) from the National Data Development and Standards Unit in Australia which describes a dataset as</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A data set is a set of data that is collected for a specific purpose. There are many ways inÂ which data can be collectedâfor example, as part of service delivery, one-off surveys,Â interviews, observations, and so on. In order to ensure that the meaning of data in the dataÂ set is clearly understood and data can be consistently collected and used, data are definedÂ using metadata&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This too has the notion of context and clear definitions to support usage, but also notes that the data may be collected in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2>A Legal Definition</h2>
<p>As it happens, there&#8217;s also a legal definition of a dataset in the UK, at least as far as it relates to the Freedom of Information. The &#8220;<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/9/part/6">Protections of Freedom Act 2012 Part 6, (102) c</a>&#8221; includes the following definition:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this Act âdatasetâ means information comprising a collection of information held in electronic form where all or most of the information in the collectionâ</p>
<ul>
<li>(a)has been obtained or recorded for the purpose of providing a public authority with information in connection with the provision of a service by the authority or the carrying out of any other function of the authority,</li>
<li>(b)is factual information whichâ
<ul>
<li>(i)is not the product of analysis or interpretation other than calculation, and</li>
<li>(ii)is not an official statistic (within the meaning given by section 6(1) of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007), and</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(c)remains presented in a way that (except for the purpose of forming part of the collection) has not been organised, adapted or otherwise materially altered since it was obtained or recorded.â</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition is useful as it defines the boundaries for what type of data is covered by Freedom of Information requests. It clearly states that the data is collected as part of the normal business of the public body and also that the data is essentially &#8220;raw&#8221;, i.e. not the result of analysis or has not been adapted or altered.</p>
<p>Raw data (as <a href="http://www.opendataimpacts.net/2012/03/untangling-the-open-data-debate-definitions-and-implications/">defined here</a>!) is more useful as it supports more downstream usage. <a href="http://blog.ldodds.com/2012/07/20/data-is-potential/">Raw data has more potential</a>.</p>
<h2>Statistical Datasets</h2>
<p>The statistical community has also worked towards having a clear definition of dataset. The <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=542">OECD Glossary defines a Dataset</a>Â as &#8220;any organised collection of data&#8221;, but then includes context that describes that further. For example that a dataset is a set of values that have a common structure and are usually thematically related. However there&#8217;s also this note that suggests that a dataset may also be made up of derived data:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A data set is any permanently stored collection of information usually containing either case level data, aggregation of case level data, or statistical manipulations of either the case level or aggregated survey data, for multiple survey instances&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Privacy is one key reason why a dataset may contain derived information only.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube">RDF Data Cube vocabulary</a>, which borrows heavily from <a href="http://sdmx.org/">SDMX</a> &#8212; a key standard in the statistical community &#8212; <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#datasets">defines a dataset </a>as being made up of several parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>&#8220;Observations -Â This is the actual data, the measured numbers. In a statistical table, the observations would be the numbers in the table cells.</li>
<li>Organizational structure -Â To locate an observation within the hypercube, one has at least to know the value of each dimension at which the observation is located, so these values must be specified for each observation&#8230;</li>
<li>Internal metadata -Â Having located an observation, we need certain metadata in order to be able to interpret it. What is the unit of measurement? Is it a normal value or a series break? Is the value measured or estimated?&#8230;</li>
<li>External metadata &#8211;Â This is metadata that describes the dataset as a whole, such as categorization of the dataset, its publisher, and a SPARQL endpoint where it can be accessed.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://sdmx.org/docs/2_0/SDMX_2_0%20SECTION_06_ImplementorsGuide.pdf">SDMX implementors guide</a> has a long definition of dataset (page 7) which also focuses on the organisation of the data and specifically how individual observations are qualified along different dimensions and measures.</p>
<h2>Scientific and Research Datasets</h2>
<p>Over the last few years the scientific and research community have been working towards making their datasets more open, discoverable and accessible. Organisations like the Welcome Foundation have published <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Data-sharing/Guidance-for-researchers/index.htm">guidance for researchers on data sharing</a>;Â services like <a href="http://crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> and <a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> provide the means for giving datasets stable identifiers; and platforms like <a href="http://figshare.com/">FigShare</a> support the publishing and sharing process.</p>
<p>While I couldn&#8217;t find a definition of dataset from that community (happy to take pointers!) its clear that the definition of dataset is extremely broad. It could cover both raw results, e.g. output from sensors or equipment, through to more analysed results. The <a href="http://citingbytes.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/what-is-dataset-when-you-get-down-to-it.html">boundaries are hard to define</a>.</p>
<p>Given the broad range of data formats and standards, services like FigShare accept any or all data formats. But as <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Data-sharing/Guidance-for-researchers/index.htm#one">the Welcome Trust note</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Data should be shared in accordance with recognised data standards where these exist, and in a way that maximises opportunities for data linkage and interoperability. Sufficient metadata must be provided to enable the dataset to be used by others. Agreed best practice standards for metadata provision should be adopted where these are in place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This echoes the earlier definitions that included supporting materials as being part of the dataset.</p>
<h2>RDF Datasets</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of RDF vocabularies already, but within the RDF and Linked Data community there are a couple of other definitions of dataset to be found. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void">Vocabulary for Organising Interlinked Datasets</a> (VoiD) is similar to, but predates, DCAT. Whereas DCAT focuses on describing a broad class of different datasets, VoiD describes a dataset as:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;a set of RDF triples that are published, maintained or aggregated by a single provider&#8230;the term dataset has a social dimension: we think of a dataset as a meaningful collection of triples, that deal with a certain topic, originate from a certain source or process, are hosted on a certain server, or are aggregated by a certain custodian. Also, typically a dataset is accessible on the Web, for example through resolvable HTTP URIs or through a SPARQL endpoint, and it contains sufficiently many triples that there is benefit in providing a concise summary.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Like the more general definitions this includes the notion that the data may relate to a specific topic or be curated by a single organisation. But this definition also makes some assumption about the technical aspects of how the data is organised and published. VoiD also includes support for <a href="blog.ldodds.com/2013/02/04/dataset-and-api-discovery-in-linked-data/">linking to the services</a> that relate to a dataset.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, SPARQL also has <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rdfDataset">a definition of a Dataset</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A SPARQL query is executed against anÂ RDF DatasetÂ which represents a collection of graphs. An RDF Dataset comprises one graph, the default graph, which does not have a name, and zero or more named graphs, where each named graph is identified by an IRI&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a technical specification this is a very narrow definition of dataset. It also differs from the VoiD definition. While both assume RDF as the means for organising the data, the VoiD term is more general, e.g. it glosses over details of the internal organisation of the dataset into named graphs. This results in some awkwardness when attempting to navigate between a VoiD description and a SPARQL Service Description.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve gotten this far, then well done <span class='wp-smiley emoji emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a couple of things we can draw out from these definitions which might help us when discussing &#8220;datasets&#8221;:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">There&#8217;s a clear sense that a dataset relates to specific topic and is collected for a particular purpose.</span></li>
<li>The means by which a dataset is collected and the definitions of its contents are important for supporting proper re-use</li>
<li>Whether a dataset consists of &#8220;raw data&#8221; or more analysed results can vary across communities. Both forms of dataset might be available, but in some circumstances (e.g. for privacy reasons) only derived data might be published</li>
<li>Depending on your perspective and your immediate use case the dataset may be just the data items, perhaps expressed in a particular way (e.g. as RDF). Â But in a broader sense, the dataset also includes the supporting documentation, definitions, licensing statements, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there&#8217;s a common core to these definitions, different communities do have slightly different outlooks that are likely to affect how they expect to publish, describe and share data on the web.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/753/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/leighdodds.wordpress.com/753/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.ldodds.com&#038;blog=36454313&#038;post=753&#038;subd=leighdodds&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
