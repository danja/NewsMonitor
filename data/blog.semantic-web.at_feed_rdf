<p><strong><a href="http://www.taxonomystrategies.com" target="_blank">Taxonomy Strategies</a> has been working with the <a class="zem_slink" title="American Physical Society" href="http://www.aps.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">American Physical Society</a> (APS) to develop a new faceted classification scheme.</strong></p>
<p>The proposed scheme includes several discrete sets of categories called facets whose values can be combined to express concepts such as existing <strong><a class="zem_slink" title="Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_and_Astronomy_Classification_Scheme" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme</a> (PACS) codes</strong>, as well as new concepts that have not yet emerged, or have been difficult to express with the existing PACS.</p>
<p>PACS codes formed a single-hierarchy classification scheme, designed to assign the âone bestâ category that an item will be classified under. <strong>Classification schemes come from the need to physically locate objects in one dimension</strong>, for example in a library where a book will be shelved in one and only one location, among an ordered set of other books. Traditional journal tables of contents similarly place each article in a given issue in a specific location among an ordered set of other articles, certainly a necessary constraint with paper journals and still useful online as a comfortable and familiar context for readers.</p>
<p><strong>However, the real world of concepts is multi-dimensional</strong>. In collapsing to one dimension, a classification scheme makes essentially arbitrary choices that have the effect of placing some related items close together while leaving other related items in very distant bins. It also has the effect of repeating the terms associated with the last dimension in many different contexts, leading to an appearance of significant redundancy and complexity in locating terms.</p>
<p><strong>A faceted taxonomy attempts to identify each stand-alone concept through the term or terms commonly associated with it</strong>, and have it mean the same thing whenever used. Hierarchy in a taxonomy is useful to group related terms together; however the intention is not to attempt to identify an item such as an article or book by a single concept, but rather to assign multiple concepts to represent the meaning. In that way, related items can be closely associated along multiple dimensions corresponding to each assigned concept. Where previously a single PACS code was used to indicate the research area, now two, three, or more of the new concepts may be needed (although often a single new concept will be sufficient). <strong>This requires a different mindset and approach in applying the new taxonomy to the way APS has been accustomed to working with PACS</strong>; however it also enables significant new capabilities for publishing and working with all types of content including articles, papers and websites.</p>
<p>To build and maintain the faceted taxonomy, <strong>APS has acquired the <a href="http://www.poolparty.biz" target="_blank">PoolParty</a> taxonomy management tool</strong>. PoolParty will enable APS editorial staff to create, retrieve, update and delete taxonomy term records. The tool will support the various thesaurus, knowledge organization system and ontology standards for concepts, relationships, alternate terms etc. It will also provide methods for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associating taxonomy terms with content items, and storing that association in a content index record.</li>
<li>Automated indexing to suggest taxonomy terms that should be associated with content items, and text mining to suggest terms to potentially be added to the taxonomy.</li>
<li>Integrating taxonomy term look-up, browse and navigation in a selection user interface that, for example, authors and the general public could use.</li>
<li>Implementing a feedback user interface allowing authors and the general public to suggest terms, record the source of the suggestion, and inform the user on the disposition of their suggestion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arthur Smith, project manager for the new APS taxonomy notes</strong> &#8220;PoolParty allows our subject matter experts to immediately visualize the layout of the taxonomy, to add new concepts, suggest alternatives, and to map out the relationships and mappings to other concept schemes that we need. While our project is still in an early stage, the software tool is already proving very useful.&#8221;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The <strong>Simple Knowledge Organization System</strong> (SKOS) has become one of the âsweet spotsâ in the linked data ecosystem in recent years. Especially when semantic web technologies are being adapted for the requirements of enterprises or public administration, SKOS has played a most central role to create knowledge graphs.</p>
<p>In this webinar, key people from the Semantic Web Company will describe why controlled vocabularies based on SKOS play a <strong>central role in a linked data strategy</strong>, and how SKOS can be enriched by ontologies and linked data to further improve semantic information management.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SKOS unfolds its potential at the <strong>intersection of three disciplines</strong> and their methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>library sciences: taxonomy and thesaurus management</li>
<li>information sciences: knowledge engineering and ontology management</li>
<li>computational linguistics: text mining and entity extraction</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Linked Data based IT-architectures</strong> cover all three aspects and provide means for agile data, information, and knowledge management.</p>
<p>In this webinar, you will learn about the following questions and topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>How SKOS builds the foundation of enterprise knowledge graphs to be enriched by additional vocabularies and ontologies?</li>
<li>How can knowledge graphs be used build the backbone of metadata services in organisations?</li>
<li>How text mining can be used to create high-quality taxonomies and thesauri?</li>
<li>How can knowledge graphs be used for enterprise information integration?</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on <a href="http://www.poolparty.biz">PoolParty Semantic Suite</a>, you will see <strong>several live demos</strong> of end-user applications based on linked data and of <strong>PoolPartyâs latest release</strong> which provides outstanding facilities for professional linked data management, including taxonomy, thesaurus and ontology management.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Two live demos of PoolParty Semantic Integrator demonstrate new ways to retrieve information based on linked data technologies</strong></p>
<p><a style="font-style: normal; line-height: 24px; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/data-visualisation.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3700" style="border-color: #bbbbbb; margin-top: 0.4em; background-color: #eeeeee;" alt="data visualisation" src="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/data-visualisation-300x229.png" width="300" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>Linked data graphs can be used to annotate and categorize documents. By transforming text into RDF graphs and linking them with LOD like DBpedia, Geonames, MeSH etc. completely new ways to make queries over large document repositories become possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://integrator.poolparty.biz/report_medicine/" target="_blank"><strong>An online-demo</strong></a> illustrates those principles: Imagine you wereÂ an information officer at the Global Health Observatory of the World Health Organisation. You inform policy makers about the global situation in specific disease areas to direct support to the required health support programs. For your research you need data about disease prevalence in relation with socioeconomic factors.</p>
<p><strong>Datasets and technology</strong></p>
<p>About 160.000 scientific abstracts from PubMed, linked to three different disease categories were collected. Abstracts were automatically annotated with PoolParty Extractor, based on terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Geonames that are organized in a SKOS thesaurus, managed with PoolParty Thesaurus Server. Abstracts were transformed to RDF and stored in Virtuoso RDF store. In the next step, it is easy to combine these data sets within the triple store with large linked data sources like DBPedia, Geonames or Yago. The use of linked data makes it easy to e.g. group annotated countries by the Human Development Index (HDI). The hierarchical structure of the thesaurus was used to collect all concepts that are connected to a specific disease.</p>
<p>This demo was developed based on the libraries sgvizler to visualize SPARQL results. AngularJS was used to dynamically replace variables in SPARQL query templates.</p>
<p>Another example of linked data based search in the field of renewable energy can be tried out <a href="http://integrator.poolparty.biz/report_renewable/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

It also developed a network of experts as its partner organizations, which deliver services for system integration (e.g. SharePoint, FirstSpirit, IntraFind etc.), taxonomy and thesaurus management, and to develop infrastructure for the corporate semantic web. <a href="http://www.dti.ch/index.php/en/" target="_blank">DTI AG</a> is one of those partners which are acting globally as an interface between PoolParty team and the customers. Andreas Blumauer talked with <strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bruno-eugster/29/335/b43" target="_blank">Bruno Eugster</a>, CEO at DTI AG, based in Switzerland</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Blumauer</strong>: How do semantic technologies fit into your overall strategy, do you believe they are &#8216;the next big thing&#8217;?</p>
<p><strong>Eugster</strong>: DTI AG focuses on projects to improve information access and search, where semantic technologies play an ever important role. In this respect, semantic technologies are one of the next &#8220;big things&#8221;. Only if computers will understand crawled content, as well as the needs of the information seeker, the user will be able to get the right information in time. This is the key challenge which semantic technology will help to meet.</p>
<p><strong>Blumauer</strong>: Which kind of projects in the field of semantic technologies do you mainly support? What are the business cases in such projects?</p>
<p><strong>Eugster</strong>: Everywhere where information workers drive customer&#8217;s business, semantic technologies are of great help to get precise hits in time. This is the case for DTI&#8217;s projects in the sectors of enterprise search, knowledge management, eDiscovery, legal investigations as well as in government, pharma, finance, and insurance industry.</p>
<p><strong>Blumauer</strong>: How do your customers benefit from PoolParty technologies? Why did you decide to develop a partnership with Semantic Web Company?</p>
<p><strong>Eugster</strong>: In our days, where loads of information dislocated in countless data silos, it&#8217;s enormously important to bring already pre-filtered information to the employee&#8217;s desk. As each employee has it&#8217;s own requirements to given information &#8211; depending on his role and job. PoolParty allows to enrich the information with these contexts. At DTI AG,Â  we have found a dynamic and innovative technology partner with PoolParty, to achieve customer demands in information access and search.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
<p>Bruno Eugster is founder of DTI AG which is an independent solution provider in the field of intelligent information search and retrieval. Their target markets are media, financial, life sciences and government.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 10px;">&#8220;Product development is an information intensive process, which relies heavily on the division of labor. Thus, product development is not only of high cognitive, but also of high social complexity. Employees in product development possess different âthought worldsâ of the product, its components and its development process, that is, they see the product differently. These different âthought worldsâ cause communication â and consequently collaboration, which is the topmost success factor in product development â to break down.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this years <a href="http://i-semantics.tugraz.at/">I-Semantics</a> Kai Holzweissig describes the use of controlled vocabularies and product development process reference models at Daimler. The use of controlled vocabulary and the corresponding process reference model as a âdiscursive anchorâ gives employees at Daimler a toolset to harmonize their âthought worldsâ. This can result in higher efficiency and effectiveness in product development by fostering inter-departmental collaboration.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ongoing debate around the question whether &#8216;there is money in linked data or not&#8217; has now been<b>Â f</b><b>or</b><b>mul</b><b>ated </b><b>m</b><b>or</b><b>e poignantlyÂ </b>byÂ <a href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-jainpr" target="_blank">Prateek Jain</a> (one of the authors of the <a href="http://lod2.eu/BlogPost/1678-there-is-no-money-in-linked-data.html" target="_blank">original article</a>) recently: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lod/2013Jun/0036.html" target="_blank">He is asking</a>, &#8216;<strong>why linked <em>open</em> data hasn&#8217;t been used that much so far besides for research projects?</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p>I believe there are <strong>two reasons</strong> (amongst others) for the low uptake of LOD in non-academic settings which haven&#8217;t been discussed in detail until today:</p>
<p><strong>1. The LOD cloud covers mainly &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_knowledge" target="_blank">general knowledge</a>&#8216; in contrast to &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge" target="_blank">domain knowledge</a>&#8216;</strong></p>
<p>Since most organizations live on their internal knowledge which they combine intelligently with very specific (and most often publicly available) knowledge (and data), they would benefit from LOD only if certain domains were covered. A frequently quoted &#8216;best practice&#8217; for LOD is that portion of data sets which is available atÂ <a href="http://bio2rdf.org" target="_blank">Bio2RDF</a>. This part of the LOD cloud has been used again and again by the life sciences industry due to its specific information and its highly active maintainers.</p>
<p><strong>We need more &#8216;micro LOD clouds&#8217; like this</strong>.</p>
<p>Another example for such is the one which represents the <a href="https://wiki1.hbz-nrw.de/display/SEM/2013/03/11/Visualizing+lobid+as+part+of+the+LOD+cloud" target="_blank">German Library Linked Open Data Cloud</a> (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/acka47" target="_blank">Adrian Pohl</a> for this pointer!) or the <a href="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/reegle-lod-cloud.png"><strong>Clean Energy Linked Open Data Cloud</strong></a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/reegle-lod-cloud.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3335" alt="reegle-lod-cloud" src="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/reegle-lod-cloud-1024x930.png" width="584" height="530" /></a></p>
<p>I believe that the first generation of LOD cloud has done a great job. It has visualised the general principles of linked data and was able to communicate the idea behind. It even helped &#8211; at least in the very first versions of it &#8211; to identify possibly interesting data sets. And most of all: it showed how fast the cloud was growing and attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p><strong>But now it&#8217;s time to clean up</strong>:</p>
<p>A first step should be to make a clear distinction between the section of the LOD cloud which is <a href="http://opendefinition.org" target="_blank">open</a> and which is not. Datasets without licenses should be marked explicitly, because those are the ones which are <strong>most problematic for commercial use</strong>, not the ones which are not open.</p>
<p>A second improvement could be made by making some quality criteria clearly visible. I believe that the most important one is about maintenance and authorship: Who takes responsibility for the quality and trustworthiness of the data? Who exactly is the maintainer?</p>
<p>This brings me to the second and most important reason for the low uptake of LOD in commercial applications:</p>
<p><strong>2. Most datasets of the LOD cloud are maintained by a single person or by nobody at all </strong>(at least as stated onÂ <a href="http://datahub.io/" target="_blank">datahub.io</a>)</p>
<p>Would you integrate a web service which is provided by a single, maybe private person into a (core-)application of your company? Wouldn&#8217;t you prefer to work with data and services provided by a legal entity which has high reputation at least in its own knowledge domain? We all know: data has very little value if it&#8217;s not maintained in a professional manner. An example for aÂ &#8217;good practice&#8217; is the <a href="http://datahub.io/dataset/dnb-gemeinsame-normdatei" target="_blank">integrated authority file</a> provided by German National Library. I think this is a trustworthy source, isn&#8217;t it? And we can expect that it will be maintained in the future.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s not the data only which is linked in a LOD cloud</strong>, most of all it&#8217;s the people and organizations &#8216;behind the datasets&#8217; that will be linked and will co-operate and communicate based on their datasets. They will create on top of their joint data infrastructure efficient collaboration platforms, like the one in the area of clean energy &#8211; the &#8216;<strong>Trusted Clean Energy LOD Cloud</strong>&#8216;:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/reegle.info-trusted-links.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3351" alt="reegle.info trusted links" src="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/reegle.info-trusted-links-1024x933.png" width="584" height="532" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.reeep.org" target="_blank">REEEP</a> and its <a href="http://www.reegle.info" target="_blank">reegle-LD platform</a> has become a central hub in the clean energy community. Not only data-wise but also as an <strong>important cooperation partner in a network</strong> of NGOs and other types of stakeholders which promote clean energy globally.</p>
<p><strong>Linked Data has become the basis for more effective communication in that sector.</strong></p>
<p>To sum up: To publish LOD which is interesting for the usage beyond research projects, datasets should be <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>trustworthy </strong>(another example is the <a href="http://datahub.io/dataset/german-labor-law-thesaurus" target="_blank">German labor law thesaurus</a> by Wolters Kluwer). I am not saying that datasets like DBpedia are waivable. They serve as important hubs in the LOD cloud, but for non-academic projects based on LOD we need an additional layer of linked open datasets, the <strong>Trusted LOD cloud</strong>.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe that the ongoing debate whether there <a href="http://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/pub/nomoneylod.pdf" target="_blank">âis money in linked (open) data or not</a>â is a bit misleading. <strong>âLinked (open) dataâ is not only the data itself</strong>. Itâs much more, even more than yet another technology stack. Linked data is most of all a set of principles how to organize information in agile organizations that are embedded in fast moving and dynamic environments. And from this perspective there is a huge amount of money in it â but let me refine that a bit later.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/networkMan.jpg"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-3322" alt="networkMan" src="http://blog.semantic-web.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/networkMan-1024x576.jpg" width="584" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>Crying out loud in 2013 that âthere is no money in linked dataâ is an important step towards the right direction because it points out that data publishers should be more precise with data licensing. Although quite flexible licensing models would already exist â itâs the people (and probably other legal entities) who forget to publish their data together with statements about the âopennessâ of it. As a result, the data remains closed for commercial users. This hasnât been properly noticed in the early days of the linked open data cloud since commercial users havenât been around at all (in contrast to academic institutions which considered the LOD cloud to be a wonderful playground). Itâs the same thing with linked data as a technology and linked data as a set of standards: the standards and the technology stack are mature now (just think about <a href="http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/results/V7/index.html" target="_blank">Virtuosoâs brilliant SPARQL performance</a>, for example), but most people from IT still wouldnât have things like URIs, RDF and SPARQL off the top of their head when they seek solutions for powerful data integration methodologies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why is that?</strong></em></p>
<p>I believe that so far âlinked dataâ has always been perceived by people from outside the linked data core-community only as a new way to organize <strong>data on the web</strong>, thus technologies are still not mature for enterprises.</p>
<p>But the truth is, that linked data has at least a threefold nature. Linked data is</p>
<ol>
<li>a method to organize information in general, not only on the web but also in enterprises</li>
<li>a set of standards which is flexible and expressive enough to link data across boundaries (organizational, political, philosophical), cultures and languages</li>
<li>a way of using IT <em>and</em> information in a quite intuitive way, very close to the patterns like human beings tend to create realities, thus comprehensible also for non-techies.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that technologists have made a brilliant job so far with creating the linked data technology stack, its underlying standards, triple-stores and quad-stores, reasoners etc., and for specialists itâs absolutely clear why this kind of technologies will outperform traditional databases, BI-tools, search engines etc. by far.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>: the crucial point now is that enterprises have to adapt linked data technologies inside their corporate boundaries (and not only for SEO purposes or the like). The key question is not whether there is enough LOD out there for app-makers or not. High-quality LOD will be produced very quickly as soon as there are commercial consumers like large enterprises. I am not talking about use cases for linked data in the fields of data publishing or SEO.</p>
<p><strong> The main driver for the further Linked Data development will be enterprises which embrace LDÂ technologies for their internal information management. </strong></p>
<p>Itâs true that there are already some large companies (like <a href="http://de.slideshare.net/EUDataForum/edf2013-talk-of-european-data-innovator-award-winner-michael-gorriz-cio-of-daimler-from-old-to-new-economy" target="_blank">Daimler</a>Â - meet them at this year&#8217;s <a href="http://i-semantics.tugraz.at" target="_blank">I-SEMANTICS</a> in Graz!) dealing with that question but to be honest: there is not the same hype around âlinked dataâ as we can see with âbig dataâ. IBM, Microsoft &amp; Co. are not that interested in linked data of course because it is a platform by itself and doesnât foresee any kind of lucrative lock-in effects. Internet companies like Google and Facebook make use of linked data quite hesitantly. Although Facebook&#8217;s Graph Search or Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph contain large portions of this kind of technology, Google would never say &#8216;oh, we are a semantic web company now, we make heavy use of linked data, and of course we will also contribute to the LOD cloud.&#8217;</p>
<p>Why is that? Simply spoken, because through the glasses of Google, Facebook &amp; Co. the internet is a huge machine which produces data for them. Not the other way around.</p>
<p>But shouldnât the enterprise customers themselves be interested in a cost-effective way of information management? They are, but as stated before, they havenât perceived linked data as such, although it clearly is.</p>
<p>To develop technologies, we need critical questions, and of course the most critical ones always come from the inside of a community or movement. But time has come to spread the good news for the âoutsideâ.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, databases which rely on linked data standards have become mature and enough performing for many query types so that they outperform even âtraditionalâ relational databases</li>
<li>Yes, also issues which are critical for enterprise usage like privacy and security have been solved by most linked data technology vendors</li>
<li>Yes, there is a critical mass of available LOD sources (for example <a href="http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk" target="_blank">UK Ordnance Survey</a>) and also of high-quality thesauri and ontologies (for example <a href="http://vocabulary.wolterskluwer.de" target="_blank">Wolter Kluwer&#8217;s working law thesaurus</a>) to be reused in corporate settings</li>
<li>Yes, there is a volume of developers and consultants on the labor market (in the U.S. as well as in the E.U.) which is big enough to being able to execute large linked data projects</li>
<li>Yes, there are <a href="http://www.poolparty.biz/solutions/" target="_blank">tons of business cases that can benefit from linked data</a>. Linked data and semantic web technologies should be considered as core technologies for any information architecture, at least in larger corporations</li>
<li>Yes, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/" target="_blank">SPARQL Query Language</a> is not only a second SQL but comes with some brilliant features like transitive queries which help to save a lot of time when developing applications like business intelligence reporting and analysis</li>
<li>Yes, Linked Data has the potential to become the basis for a large variety of tools which help decision-makers (not only in enterprises but also in politics) to become true &#8216;digerati&#8217; instead of being degraded to masters of the &#8216;bullshit bingo&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this list can be further extended and it is a core element for the further expansion of the LOD cloud. Itâs the enterprises that will drive the next level of maturity of the linked data landscape. <strong>Because at the end of the day itâs only them who will pay or have already paid the bill for open (government) data.</strong></p>
